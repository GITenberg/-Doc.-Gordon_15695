<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER I</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was very early in the morning, it was
scarcely dawn, when the young man started
upon a walk of twenty-five miles to reach Alton,
where he was to be assistant to the one
physician in the place, Doctor Thomas Gordon,
or as he was familiarly called, "Doc."
Gordon. The young man&#39;s name was James
Elliot. He had just graduated, and this was
to be his first experience in the practice of his
profession of medicine. He was in his twenties.
He was small, but from the springiness
of his gait and the erectness of his head he
gave an impression of height. He was very
good-looking, with clearly-cut features, and
dark eyes, in which shone, like black diamonds,
sparks of mischief. They were honest
eyes, too. The young fellow was still sowing
his wild oats, but more with his hands than
with his soul. He was walking because of a
great amount of restless energy; he fairly revelled
<span class="tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span>
<a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in stretching his legs over the country
road in the keen morning air. The train service
between Gresham, his home place, and
Alton was very bad, necessitating two changes
and waits of hours, and he had fretted at
the prospect. When a young man is about
to begin his career, he does not wish to sit
hours in dingy little railroad stations on his
way toward it. It was much easier, and
pleasanter, to walk, almost run to it, as
he was doing now. His only baggage was
his little medicine-case; his trunk had gone
by train the day before. He was very well
dressed, his clothes had the cut of a city
tailor. He was almost dandified. His father
was well-to-do: a successful peach-grower
on a wholesale scale. His great farm
was sprayed over every spring with delicate
rosy garlands of peach blossoms, and in the
autumn the trees were heavy with the almond-scented
fruit. He had made a fortune,
and aside from that had achieved a certain
local distinction. He was then mayor of
Gresham, which had a city government.
James was very proud of his father and fond
of him. Indeed, he had reason to be. His
father had done everything in his power for
him, given him a good education, and supplied
<span class="tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span>
<a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him liberally with money. James had
always had a sense of plenty of money, which
had kept him from undue love of it. He was
now beginning the practice of his profession,
in a small way, it is true, but that he recognized
as expedient. "You had better get
acclimated, become accustomed to your profession
in a small place, before you launch
out in a city," his father had said, and the
son had acquiesced. It was the natural wing-trying
process before large flights were attempted,
and the course commended itself to
his reason. James, as well as his father, had
good reasoning power. He whistled to himself
as he walked along. He was very happy.
He had a sensation as of one who has his goal
in sight. He thought of his father, his mother,
and his two younger sisters, but with no distress
at absenting himself from them, although
he lived in accord with his family.
Twenty-five miles to his joyous youth seemed
but as a step across the road. He had no sense
of separation. "What is twenty-five miles?"
he had said laughingly to his mother, when
she had kissed him good-by. He had no conception
of her state of mind with regard to
the break in the home circle. He who was
the breaker did not even see the break.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span>
<a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Therefore he walked along, conscious of an
immense joy in his own soul, and wholly unconscious
of anything except joy in the souls
of those whom he had left behind. It was a
glorious morning, a white morning. The
ground was covered with white frost, the
trees, the house-roofs, the very air, were all
white. In the west a transparent moon was
slowly sinking; the east deepened with red
and violet tints. Then came the sun, upheaving
above the horizon like a ship of glory, and
all the whiteness burned, and glowed, and
radiated jewel-lights. James looked about
with the delight of a discoverer. It might
have been his first morning. He begun to
meet men going to their work, swinging tin
dinner-pails. Even these humble pails became
glorified, they gave back the sunlight
like burnished silver. He smelled the odors
of breakfast upon the men&#39;s clothes. He
held up his head high with a sort of good-humored
arrogance as he passed. He would
have fought to the death for any one of these
men, but he knew himself, quite innocently,
upon superior heights of education, and
trained thought, and ambition. He met a
man swinging a pail; he was coughing: a
wretched, long rattle of a cough. James
<span class="tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span>
<a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stopped him, opened his little medicine-case,
and produced some pellets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Here, take one of these every hour until
the cough is relieved, my friend," said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man stared, swallowed a pellet, stared
again, in an odd, suspicious, surly fashion,
muttered something unintelligible and passed
on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There were three villages between Gresham
and Alton: Red Hill, Stanbridge, and Westover.
James stopped in Red Hill at a quick-lunch
wagon, which was drawn up on the
principal street under the lee of the town
hall, went in, ordered and ate with relish
some hot frankfurters, and drank some coffee.
He had eaten a plentiful breakfast before
starting, but the keen air had created his
appetite anew. Beside him at the counter sat
a young workingman, also eating frankfurters
and drinking coffee. Now and then he
gave a sidelong and supercilious glance at
James&#39;s fine clothes. James caught one of the
glances, and laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"These quick-lunch wagons are a mighty
good idea," said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man grunted and took a swallow of
coffee.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where do you work?" asked James.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span>
<a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"None of your d—— business!" retorted
the other man unexpectedly. "Where do you
work yourself?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James stared at him, then he burst into a
roar. For a second the man&#39;s surly mouth
did not budge, then the corners twitched a
little.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What in thunder are you mad about?"
inquired James. "I am going to work for
Doctor Gordon in Alton, and I don&#39;t care a
d—— where you work." James spoke with
the most perfect good nature, still laughing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then the man&#39;s face relaxed into a broad
grin. "Didn&#39;t know but you were puttin&#39;
on lugs," said he. "I am about tired of all
those damned benefactors comin&#39; along and
arskin&#39; of a man whot&#39;s none of their business,
when a man knows all the time they
don&#39;t care nothin&#39; about it, and then makin&#39;
a man take somethin&#39; he don&#39;t want, so as to
get their names in the papers." The man
sniffed a sniff of fury, then his handsome blue
eyes smiled pleasantly, even with mischievous
confidence into James&#39;s, and he swallowed
more coffee.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am no benefactor, you can bet your life
on that," said James. "I don&#39;t mean to give
you anything you want or don&#39;t want."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span>
<a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Didn&#39;t know but you was one of that
kind," returned the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man eyed James&#39;s clothes expressively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, you mean my clothes," said James.
"Well, this suit and overcoat are pretty fair,
but if I were a benefactor I should be wearing
seedy clothes, and have my wallet stuffed
with bills for other folks."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You bet you wouldn&#39;t," said the other
man. "That ain&#39;t the way benefactors go to
work. What be you goin&#39; to do at Doc Gordon&#39;s?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Drive," replied James laconically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Guess you can&#39;t take care of hosses in
no sech togs as them."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ve got some others. I&#39;m going to learn
to doctor a little, too, if I can."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man surveyed him, then he burst into
a great laugh. "Well," said he, "when I git
the measles I&#39;ll call you in."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All right," said James, "I won&#39;t charge
you a red cent. I&#39;ll doctor you and all your
children and your wife for nothing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Guess you won&#39;t need to charge nothin&#39;
for the wife and kids, seein&#39; as I ain&#39;t got
none," said the man. "Ketch me saddled up
with a woman an&#39; kids, if I know what I&#39;m
<span class="tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span>
<a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>about. Them&#39;s for the benefactors. I live in
a little shanty I rigged up myself out of two
packin&#39; boxes. I&#39;ve got &#39;em on a man&#39;s medder
here. He let me squat for nothin&#39;. I git
my meals here, an&#39; I work on the railroad, an&#39;
I&#39;ve got a soft snap, with nobody to butt in.
Here, Mame, give us another cup of coffee.
Mame&#39;s the girl I want, if I could hev one.
Ain&#39;t you, Mame?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The girl, who was a blonde, with an exaggerated
pompadour fastened with aggressive
celluloid pins, smiled pertly. "Reckon I
h&#39;ain&#39;t no more use for men than you hev for
women," said she, as she poured the coffee.
All that could be seen of her behind the
counter was her head, and her waist clad in a
red blouse, pinned so high to her skirt in the
rear that it almost touched her shoulder
blades. The blouse was finished at the neck
with a nice little turn-over collar fastened
with a brooch set with imitation diamonds
and sapphires.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now, Mame, you know," said the man
with assumed pathos, "that it is only because
I&#39;m a poor devil that I don&#39;t go kerflop the
minute I set eyes on you. But you wouldn&#39;t
like to live in boxes, would you? Would you
now?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span>
<a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not till my time comes, and not in boxes,
then, less I&#39;m in a railroad accident," replied
the girl, with ghastly jocularity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She&#39;s got another feller, or <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">you</span> might git
her if you&#39;ve got a stiddy job," the man said,
winking at James with familiarity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Just my luck," said James. He looked at
the girl, and thought her pretty and pathetic,
with a vulgar, almost tragic, prettiness and
pathos. She was anÃ¦mic and painfully thin.
Her blouse was puffed out over her flat chest.
She looked worn out with the miserable little
tediums of life, with constant stepping over
ant-hills of stupidity and petty hopelessness.
Her work was not, comparatively speaking,
arduous, but the serving of hot coffee and
frankfurters to workingmen was not progressive,
and she looked as if her principal
diet was the left-overs of the stock in trade.
She seemed to exhale an odor of musty sandwiches
and sausages and muddy coffee.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man swallowed his second cup in fierce
gulps. He glanced at his Ingersoll watch.
"Gee whiz!" said he. "It&#39;s time I was off!
Good-by, Mame."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The girl turned her head with a toss, and
did not reply. "Good-by," James said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man grinned. "Good-by, Doc," he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span>
<a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said. "I&#39;ll call you when I git the measles.
You&#39;re a good feller. If you&#39;d been a benefactor
I&#39;d run you out."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man clattered down the steps of the
gaudily painted little structure. The girl
whom he had called Mame turned and looked
at James with a sort of innocent boldness.
"He&#39;s a queer feller," she observed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He seems to be."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He is, you bet. Livin&#39; in a house he&#39;s
built out of boxes when he makes big money.
He&#39;s on strike every little while. I wouldn&#39;t
look at him. Don&#39;t know what he&#39;s drivin&#39; at
half the time. Reckon he&#39;s—" She touched
her head significantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Lots of folks are," said James affably.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s so." She stared reflectively at
James. "I&#39;m keepin&#39; this quick lunch &#39;cause
my father&#39;s sick," said she. "I see a lot of
human nature in here."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose you do."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You bet. Every kind gits in here first
and last, tramps up to swells who think
they&#39;re doin&#39; somethin&#39; awful funny to git
frankfurters and coffee in here. They must
be hard driv."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose they are sometimes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mame&#39;s eyes, surveying James, suddenly
<span class="tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span>
<a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>grew sharp. "You ain&#39;t one?" she asked
accusingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You bet not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mame&#39;s grew soft. "I knew you were
all right," said she. "Sometimes they say
things to me that their fine lady friends would
bounce &#39;em for, but I knew the minute I saw
you that you wasn&#39;t that kind if you be
dressed up like a gent. Reckon you&#39;ve been
makin&#39; big money in your last place."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Considerable," admitted James. He felt
like a villain, but he had not the heart to accuse
himself of being a gentleman before this
pathetic girl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mame leaned suddenly over the counter,
and her blonde crest nearly touched his forehead.
"Say," said she, in a whisper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What?" whispered James back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What he said ain&#39;t true. There ain&#39;t a
mite of truth in it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What he said," repeated James vaguely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mame pouted. "How awful thick-headed
you be," said she. "What he said about my
havin&#39; a feller." She blushed rosily, and her
eyes fell.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt his own face suffused. He
pulled out his pocket-book, and rose abruptly.
"I&#39;m sorry," he said with stupidity.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span>
<a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">The rosy flush died away from the girl&#39;s
face. "Nobody asked you to be sorry," said
she. "I could have any one of a dozen I
know if I jest held out my little finger."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course, you could," James said. He
felt apologetic, although he did not know
exactly why. He fumbled over the change,
and at last made it right with a quarter extra
for the girl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s a quarter too much," said she.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Keep it, please."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She hesitated. She was frowning under
her great blonde roll, her mouth looked hurt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What a fuss about a quarter," said James,
with a laugh. "Keep it. That&#39;s a good girl."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mame took a dingy handkerchief out of
the bosom of her blouse, untied a corner, and
James heard a jingle of coins meeting. Then
she laughed. "You&#39;re an awful fraud,"
said she.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You can&#39;t cheat me, if you did Bill Slattery."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think I don&#39;t know what you mean."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;re a gent."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The girl&#39;s thin, coarse laughter rang out
after James as he descended the steps of the
quick-lunch wagon. She opened the door
<span class="tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span>
<a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>directly after he had closed it, and stood on
the top step with the cold wind agitating her
fair hair. "Say," she called after him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James turned as he walked away. "What
is it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothin&#39;, only I was foolin&#39; you, and so
was Bill. I&#39;ve got a feller, and Bill&#39;s him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ll make you a present when you&#39;re
married," James called back with a laugh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s to come off next summer," cried the
girl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I won&#39;t forget," answered James. He
knew the girl lied; that she was not about to
marry the workingman. He said to himself,
as he strode on refreshed with his coarse fare,
that girls were extraordinary: first they were
bold to positive indecency, then modest to the
borders of insanity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James walked on. He reached Stanbridge
about noon. Then he was hungry again.
There was a good hotel there, and he made a
substantial meal. He had a smoke and a
rest of half an hour, then he resumed his
walk. He soon passed the outskirts of Stanbridge,
which was a small, old city, then he
was in the country. The houses were sparsely
set well back from the road. He met nobody,
except an occasional countryman driving
<span class="tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span>
<a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a wood-laden team. Presently the road
lay between stately groves of oaks, although
now and then they stood on one side only of
the highway. Nearly all the oaks bore a shag
of dried leaves about their trunks, like mossy
beards of old men, only the shag was a bright
russet instead of white. The ground under
the oaks was like cloth-of-gold under the
sun, the fallen leaves yet retained so much
color. James heard a sharp croak, then a
crow flew with wide flaps of dark wings
across the road and perched on an oak bough.
It cocked its head, and watched him wisely.
James whistled at it, but it did not stir. It
remained with its head cocked in that attitude
of uncanny wisdom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly James saw before him the figure
of a girl, moving swiftly. She must have
come out of the wood. She went as freely
as a woodland thing, although she was conventionally
dressed in a tailor suit of brown.
Her hat, too, was brown, and a brown feather
curled over the brim. She walked fast, with
evidently as much enjoyment of the motion
as James himself. They both walked like
winged things.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly James had a queer experience.
One sense became transposed into another, as
<span class="tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span>
<a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one changes the key in music. He heard absolutely
nothing, but it was as if he saw a noise.
He saw a man standing on the right between
him and the girl. The man had not made the
slightest sound, he was sure. James had good
ears, but sound and not sight was what betrayed
him, or rather sound transposed into
sight. He stood as motionless as a tree himself.
James knew that he had been looking at
the girl. Now she was looking at him. James
felt a long shudder creep over him. He had
never been afraid of anything except fear.
Now he was afraid of fear, and there was
something about the man which awakened
this terror, yet it was inexplicable. He was
a middle-aged man, and distinctly handsome.
He was something above the medium height,
and very well dressed. He wore a fur-lined
coat which looked opulent. He had gray hair
and a black mustache. There was nothing
menacing in his face. He was, indeed, smiling
a curious retrospective smile, as if at his
own thoughts. Although his eyes regarded
James attentively, this smiling mouth seemed
entirely oblivious of him. The man gave an
odd impression, as of two personalities: the
one observant, with an animal-like observance
for his own weal or woe, the other observant
<span class="tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span>
<a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with intelligence. It was possibly
this impression of a dual personality which
gave James his quick sense of horror. He
walked on, feeling his very muscles shrink.
Just before James reached the man he
emerged easily, with not the slightest appearance
of stealth, from the wood, and
walked on before him with a rapid, swinging
stride. There were then three persons
upon the road: the girl in brown, the strange
man in the fur-lined coat, and James Elliot.
James quickened his pace, but the other man
kept ahead of him, and reached the girl. He
stopped and James broke into a run. He
saw the man place a hand upon the girl&#39;s
shoulder, and make a motion as if to turn
her face toward his. James came up with a
shout, and the man disappeared abruptly,
with a quick backward glance at James, into
the wood.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The girl looked at James, and her little
face under her brown plumed hat was very
white. "Oh," she gasped, as if she had always
known him, "I am so glad you are
here! He frightened me terribly."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She tried to smile at James, although her
poor little mouth was quivering. "Who was
he?" she asked.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">
<img src="images/image02.png" width="480" height="779" alt="&quot;You don&#39;t think he will come back?&quot;" class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"You don&#39;t think he will come back?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span>
<a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A sudden suspicion flashed into her eyes.
"He wasn&#39;t with you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No. I saw him on the edge of the woods
back there, and I didn&#39;t like his looks. When
he started to follow you I hurried to catch
up."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, thank you," said the girl fervently.
"Do forgive me for asking if you were with
him. I knew you were not the minute I saw
you. I did not turn my face, although he
tried to make me. I don&#39;t know why, but I
do know he was something terrible and
wicked." The girl said this last with a shudder.
She caught hold of James&#39;s arm innocently,
as a frightened child might have done.
"You don&#39;t think he will come back?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, and if he does I will take care of
you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He may be—armed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly the girl reeled. "Don&#39;t let me
faint away. I won&#39;t faint away," she said
in an angry voice. James saw that she was
actually biting her lips to overcome the faintness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If you will sit down on that rock for a
moment," said James, "I have something in
my medicine-case which will revive you. I
am a doctor."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span>
<a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I shall faint away if I sit down and give
up to it, if I swallow your whole case," said
the girl weakly. "I know myself. Let me
hold your arm and walk, and don&#39;t make me
talk, then I can get over it." She was biting
her lips almost to bleeding.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James walked on as he was bidden, with
the slender little brown-clad figure clinging
to him. He realized that he had fallen in
with a girl who had a will which was possibly
superior to anything in his medicine-case
when it came to overcoming fright.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They walked on until they came in sight of
a farm-house, when the girl spoke again, and
James saw that the color was returning to
her face. "I am all right now," said she,
and withdrew her hand from his arm. She
gave her head an angry, whimsical shake.
"I am ashamed of myself," said she, "but
I was horribly frightened, and sometimes I
do faint. I can generally get the better of
myself, but sometimes I can&#39;t. It always
makes me so angry. I do hope you don&#39;t
think I am such an awful coward, because
I am not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think most girls whom I have known
would have made much more fuss than you
did," said James. "You never screamed."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span>
<a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I never did scream in my life," said the
girl. "I don&#39;t think I could. I don&#39;t know
how. I think if I did scream, I should certainly
faint."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James stopped and opened his medicine-case.
"I think you had better take just a
swallow of brandy," said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The girl thrust back the bottle which he
offered her with high disdain. "Brandy,"
said she, "just because I have been frightened
a little! I should be ashamed of myself
if I did such a thing. I am ashamed
now for almost fainting away, but I should
never forgive myself if I took brandy because
of it. If I haven&#39;t nerve enough to
keep straight without brandy, I should be a
pretty poor specimen of a girl." She looked
at him indignantly, and James saw what he
had not seen before (he had been so engrossed
with the strangeness of the situation),
that she was a beautiful girl with a
singular type of beauty. She was very small,
but she gave the impression of intense
springiness and wiriness. Although she was
thin, no one could have called her delicate.
She looked as much alive as a flame, with
nerves on the surface from head to heel. Her
eyes were blue, not large, but full of light,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span>
<a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her hair, which tossed around her face in a
soft fluff, was ash-blonde. Brown was the
last color, theoretically, which she should
have worn, but it suited her. The ash and
brown, the two neutral tints, served to bring
out the blue fire of her eyes and the intense
red of her lips. However, her beauty lay not
so much in her regular features as in the
wonderful flame-like quality which animated
them, and which they assumed when she spoke
or listened. In repose, her face was as neutral
as a rock or dead leaf. It was neither beautiful
nor otherwise. When it was animated,
it was as if the rock gave out silver lights of
mica and rosy crystal under strong light,
and as if the dead leaf leapt into flame.
James thought her much prettier than any
of his sisters or their friends, but he was
led quite unknowingly into this opinion, because
of his own position as her protector.
That made him realize his own male gorgeousness
and strength, and he really saw
the girl with such complacency instead of
himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They walked along, and all at once he
stopped short. Something occurred to him,
which, strange to say, had not occurred before.
He was not in the least cowardly. He
<span class="tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span>
<a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was brave almost to foolhardiness. All at
once it occurred to him that he ought to follow
the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Good Lord!" said he and stopped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What is the matter?" asked the girl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, I must follow that man. He is a
suspicious character. He ought not to be
left at large."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose you don&#39;t care if you leave me
alone," said the girl accusingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James stared at her doubtfully. There
was that view of the situation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am going to see my friend Annie Lipton,
who lives in Westover. There is half a
mile of lonely road before I get there. That
man, for all I know, may be keeping sight
of us in the woods over there. While you
are going back to chase him, he may come up
with me. Well, run along if you want to.
I am not afraid." But the girl&#39;s lips quivered,
and she paled again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James glanced at the stretch of road ahead.
There was not a house in sight. Woods were
on one side, on the other was a rolling expanse
of meadowland covered with dried
last year&#39;s grass, like coarse oakum-colored
hair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think I had better keep on with you,"
James said.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span>
<a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You can do exactly as you choose," the
girl replied defiantly, but tremulously. "I
am not in the least dependent upon men to
escort me. I wander miles around by myself.
This is the first time I have seemed to
be in the slightest danger. I dare say there
was no danger this time, only he came up
behind like a cat, and—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He didn&#39;t say anything?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, he didn&#39;t speak. He only tried to
make me turn my head, so he could see my
face, and directly it seemed to me that I must
die rather than let him. He was trying to
make me turn my head. I think maybe he
was an insane man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I will go on with you," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They walked on for the half mile of which
the girl had spoken. A sudden shyness
seemed to have come over both of them.
Then they began to come in sight of houses.
"I am not afraid now," said the girl, "but
I do think you are very foolish if you go
back alone and try to hunt that man. Ten
chances to one he is armed, and you haven&#39;t
a thing to defend yourself with, except that
medicine-case."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have my fists," replied James indignantly.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span>
<a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Fists don&#39;t count much against a revolver."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I am going to try," said James
with emphasis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Good-by, then. You are treating me
shamefully, though."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James stared at her in amazement. She
was actually weeping, tears were rolling over
her cheeks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you mean?" said he. "Don&#39;t
feel so badly."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You can&#39;t be very quick-witted not to
see. If you should meet that man, and get
killed, I should really be the one who killed
you and not the man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, no, you would not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The girl stamped her foot. "Yes, I should,
too," said she, half-sobbing. "You would
not have been killed except for me. You
know you would not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She spoke as if she actually saw the young
man dead before her, and was indignant
because of it, and he burst into a peal of
laughter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Laugh if you want to," said she. "It
does not seem to me any laughing matter to
go and get yourself killed by me, and my
having that on my mind my whole life. I
<span class="tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span>
<a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>think I should go mad." Her voice shook,
an expression of horror came into her blue
eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James laughed again. "Very well, then,"
he said, "to oblige you I won&#39;t get killed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He, in fact, began to consider that the day
was waning, and what a wild-goose chase it
would probably be for him to attempt to follow
the man. So again they walked on until
they reached the main street of Westover.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Westover was a small village, rather smaller
than Gresham. They passed three gin-mills,
a church, and a grocery store. Then the girl
stopped at the corner of a side street. "My
friend lives on this street," said she. "Thank
you very much. I don&#39;t know what I should
have done if you had not come. Good-by!"
She went so quickly that James was not at
all sure that she heard his answering good-by.
He thought again how very handsome
she was. Then he began to wonder where
she lived, and how she would get home from
her friend&#39;s house, if the friend had a brother
who would escort her. He wondered who her
friends were to let a girl like that wander
around alone in a State which had not the
best reputation for safety. He entertained
the idea of waiting about until she left her
<span class="tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span>
<a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>friend&#39;s house, then he considered the possible
brother, and that the girl herself might
resent it, and he kept on. The western sky
was putting on wonderful tints of cowslip
and rose deepening into violet. He began
considering his own future again, relegating
the girl to the background. He must be
nearing Alton, he thought. After a three-mile
stretch of farming country, he saw
houses again. Lights were gleaming out in
the windows. He heard wheels, and the
regular trot of a horse behind him, then a
mud-bespattered buggy passed him, a shabby
buggy, but a strongly built one. The team
of horses was going at a good clip. James
stood on one side, but the team and buggy
had no sooner passed than he heard a whoa!
and a man&#39;s face peered around the buggy
wing, not at James, but at his medicine-case.
James could just discern the face, bearded
and shadowy in the gathering gloom. Then
a voice came. It shouted, one word, the expressive
patois of the countryside, that word
which may be at once a question and a salute,
may express almost any emotion. "Halloo!"
said the voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This halloo involved a question, or so
James understood it. He quickened his
<span class="tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span>
<a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pace, and came alongside the buggy. The
face, more distinct now, surveyed him, its
owner leaning out over the side of the buggy.
"Who are you? Where are you bound?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James answered the latter question. "I
am going to Alton."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"To Doctor Gordon&#39;s?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then you are Doctor Elliot?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Get in."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James climbed into the buggy. The other
man took up the reins, and the horse resumed
his quick trot.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You didn&#39;t come by train?" remarked
the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No. You are Doctor Gordon, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I am. Why the devil did you walk?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"To save my money," replied James, laughing.
He realized nothing to be ashamed of
in his reply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But I thought your father was well-to-do."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, he is, but we don&#39;t ride when it
costs money and we can walk. I knew if I
got to Alton by night, it would be soon enough.
I like to walk." James said that last rather
<span class="tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span>
<a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>defiantly. He began to realize a certain
amazement on the other man&#39;s part which
might amount to an imputation upon his
father. "I have plenty of money in my
pocket," he added, "but I wanted the walk."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon laughed. "Oh, well, a
walk of twenty-five miles is nothing to a
young fellow like you, of course," he said.
"I can understand that you may like to
stretch your legs. But you&#39;ll have to drive
if you are ever going to get anywhere when
you begin practice with me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose you have calls for miles
around?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Rather." Doctor Gordon sighed. "It&#39;s
a dog&#39;s life. I suppose you haven&#39;t got that
through your head yet?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think it is a glorious profession," returned
James, with his haughty young enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I wasn&#39;t talking about the profession,"
said the doctor; "I was talking of the man
who has to grind his way through it. It&#39;s
a dog&#39;s life. Neither your body nor your
soul are your own. Oh, well, maybe you&#39;ll
like it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You seem to," remarked James rather
pugnaciously.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span>
<a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I? What can I do, young man, but stick
to it whether I like it or not? What would
they do? Yes, I suppose I am fool enough
to like a dog&#39;s life, or rather to be unwilling
to leave it. No money could induce me anyhow.
I suppose you know there is not much
money in it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James said that he had not supposed a fortune
was to be made in a country practice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The last bill any of them will pay is the
doctor&#39;s," said Doctor Gordon. Then he
added with a laugh, "especially when the doctor
is myself. They have to pay a specialist
from New York, but I wait until they are
underground, and the relatives, I find, stick
faster to the monetary remains than the
bark to a tree. If I hadn&#39;t a little private
fortune, and my—sister a little of her own,
I expect we should starve."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James noticed with a little surprise the
doctor&#39;s hesitation before he spoke of his
sister. It seemed then that he was not married.
Somehow, James had thought of him
as married as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon hastened to explain, as if
divining the other&#39;s attitude. "I dare say
you don&#39;t know anything about my family
relations," said he. "My widowed sister,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span>
<a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Mrs. Ewing, keeps house for me. I live with
her and her daughter. I think you will like
them both, and I think they will like you,
though I&#39;ll be hanged if I have grasped anything
of you so far but your medicine-case
and your voice. Your voice is all right.
You give yourself away by it, and I always
like that."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James straightened himself a little. There
was something bantering in the other&#39;s tone.
It made him feel young, and he resented
being made to feel young. He himself at
that time felt older than he ever would feel
again. He realized that he was not being
properly estimated. "If," said he, with some
heat, "a patient can make out anything by
my voice as to what I think, I miss my guess."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I dare say not," said Doctor Gordon,
and his own voice was as if he put the matter
aside.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He spoke to the horse, whose trot quickened,
and they went on in silence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At last James began to feel rather ashamed
of himself. He unstiffened. "I had quite
an exciting and curious experience after I
left Stanbridge," said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did you?" said the other in an absent
voice.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span>
<a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">James went on to relate the matter in detail.
His companion turned an intent face
upon him as he proceeded. "How far back
was it?" he asked, and his tone was noticeably
agitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Just after I left the last house in Stanbridge.
We went on together to Westover.
She mentioned something about going to see
a friend there. I think Lipton was the name,
and she left me suddenly."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What was the girl like?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Small and slight, and very pretty."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dressed in brown?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How did the man look?" Doctor Gordon&#39;s
voice fairly alarmed the young man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I hardly can say. I saw him distinctly,
but only for a second. The impression he
gave me was of a middle-aged man, although
he looked young."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Good-looking?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"My God, no!" said James, as the man&#39;s
face seemed to loom up before him again.
"He looked like the devil."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A man may look like the devil, and yet
be distinctly handsome."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I suppose he was; but give me the
homeliest face on earth rather than a face
<span class="tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span>
<a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>like that man&#39;s, if I must needs have anything
to do with him." The young fellow&#39;s
voice broke. He was very young. He caught
the other man by his rough coat sleeve.
"See here, Doctor Gordon," said he, "my
profession is to save life. That is the main
end of it but, but—I don&#39;t honestly know
what I should think right, if I were asked
to save <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">that</span> man&#39;s life."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was he well dressed?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"More than well dressed, richly, a fur-lined
coat—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tall?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, above the medium, but he stooped a
little, like a cat, sort of stretched to the
ground like an animal, when he hurried along
after the girl in front of me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon struck the horse with his
whip, and he broke into a gallop. "We are
almost home," said he. "I shall have to
leave you with slight ceremony. I have to
go out again immediately."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon had hardly finished speaking
before they drew up in front of a white
house on the left of the road. "Get out,"
he said peremptorily to James. The front
door opened, and a parallelogram of lighted
interior became visible. In this expanse of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span>
<a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>light stood a tall woman&#39;s figure. "Clara,
this is the new doctor," called out Doctor
Gordon. "Take him in and take care of
him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Have you got to go away again?" said
the woman&#39;s voice. It was sweet and rich,
but had a curious sad quality in it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I must. I shall not be gone long.
Don&#39;t wait supper."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Aren&#39;t you going to change the horse?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Can&#39;t stop. Go right in, Elliot. Clara,
look after him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James Elliot found himself in the house,
confronting the most beautiful woman he had
ever seen, as the rapid trot of the doctor&#39;s
horse receded in vistas of sound.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James almost gasped. He had never seen
such a woman. He had seen pretty girls.
Now he suddenly realized that a girl was not
a woman, and no more to be compared with
her than an uncut gem with one whose facets
take the utmost light.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The boy stood staring at this wonderful
woman. She extended her hand to him, but
he did not see it. She said some gracious
words of greeting to him, but he did not hear
them. She might have been the Venus de
Milo for all he heard or realized of sentient
<span class="tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span>
<a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life in her. He was rapt in contemplation
of herself, so rapt that he was oblivious of
her. She smiled. She was accustomed to
having men, especially very young men, take
such an attitude on first seeing her. She did
not wait any longer, but herself took the young
man&#39;s hand, and drew him gently into the
room, and spoke so insistently that she compelled
him to leave her and attend. "I suppose
you are Doctor Gordon&#39;s assistant?"
she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James relapsed into the tricks of his childhood.
"Yes, ma&#39;am," he replied. Then he
blushed furiously, but the woman seemed to
notice neither the provincial term nor his
confusion. He found himself somehow, he
did not know how, divested of his overcoat,
and the vision had disappeared, having left
some words about dinner ringing in his ears,
and he was sitting before a hearth-fire in a
large leather easy-chair. Then he looked
about the room in much the same dazed
fashion in which he had contemplated the
woman. He had never seen a room like it.
He was used to conventionality, albeit richness,
and a degree even of luxury. Here
were absolute unconventionality, richness, and
luxury of a kind utterly strange to him.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span>
<a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The room was very large and long, extending
nearly the whole length of the house.
There were many windows with Eastern
rugs instead of curtains. There were Eastern
things hung on the walls which gave
out dull gleams of gold and silver and topaz
and turquoise. There were a great many
books on low shelves. There were bronzes,
jars, and squat idols. There were a few
pieces of Chinese ivory work. There were
many skins of lions, bears, and tigers on
the floor, besides a great Persian rug which
gleamed like a blurred jewel. Besides the
firelight there was only one great bronze
lamp to illuminate the room. This lamp
had a red shade, which cast a soft, fiery glow
over everything. There were not many pictures.
The rich Eastern stuffs, and even a
skin or two of tawny hue, covered most of
the wall-spaces above the book-cases, giving
backgrounds of color to bronzes and ivory
carvings, but there was one picture at the
farther end of the room which attracted
James&#39;s notice. All that he could distinguish
from where he sat was a splash of splendid
red.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He gazed, and his curiosity grew. Finally
he rose, traversed the room, and came close
<span class="tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span>
<a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the picture. It was a portrait of the
woman who had met him at the door. The
red was the red of a splendid robe of velvet.
The portrait was evidently the work of no
mean artist. The texture of the velvet was
something wonderful, so were the flesh tones;
but James missed something in the face.
The portrait had been painted, he knew instinctively,
before some great change had
come into the woman&#39;s heart, which had
given her another aspect of beauty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James turned away. Then he noticed something
else which seemed rather odd about the
room. All the windows were furnished with
heavy wooden shutters, and, early as it was,
hardly dark, all were closed, and fastened securely.
James somehow got an impression
of secrecy, that it was considered necessary
that no glimpse of the interior should be obtained
from without after the lamp was lit.
They sat often carelessly at his own home of
an evening with the shades up, and all the
interior of the room plainly visible from the
road. An utter lack of secrecy was in James&#39;s
own character. He scowled a little, as he returned
to his seat by the fire. He was too
confused to think clearly, but he was conscious
of a certain homesickness for the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span>
<a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wonted things of his life, when the door
opened and the woman reÃ«ntered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James rose, and she spoke in her sweet
voice. It was rather lower pitched than the
voices of most women, and had a resonant
quality. "Your room is quite ready, Doctor
Elliot," said she. "Your trunk is there. If
you would like to go there before dinner, I
will pilot you. We have but one maid, and
she is preparing the dinner, which will be
ready as soon as you are. I hope Doctor
Gordon and Clemency will have returned by
that time, too."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">By Clemency James understood that she
meant her daughter, of whom Doctor Gordon
had spoken. He wondered at the unusual
name, as he followed his hostess. His room
was on the same floor as the living-room. She
threw open a door at the other side of the hall,
and James saw an exceedingly comfortable
apartment with a hearth-fire, with book-shelves,
and a couch-bed covered with a rug,
and a desk. "I thought you would prefer
this room," said the woman. "There are
others on the second floor, but this has the
advantage of your being able to use it as a
sitting-room, and you may like to have your
friends, whom I trust you will find in Alton,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span>
<a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>come in from time to time. You will please
make yourself quite at home."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James had not yet fairly comprehended
the beauty of the woman. He was still too
dazzled. Had he gone away at that time, he
could not for the life of him have described
her, but he did glance, as a woman might
have done, at her gown. It was of a soft
heavy red silk, trimmed with lace, and was
cut out in a small square at the throat. This
glimpse of firm white throat made James
wonder as to evening costume for himself.
At home he never dreamed of such a thing,
but here it might be different. His hostess
divined his thoughts. She smiled at him as
if he were a child. "No," said she, "you
do not need to dress for dinner. Doctor Gordon
never does when we are by ourselves."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then she went away, closing the door softly
after her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James noticed that over the windows of
this room were only ordinary shades, and
curtains of some soft red stuff. There were no
shutters. He looked about him. He was
charmed with his room, and it did away to
a great extent with his feeling of homesickness.
It was not unlike what his room at
college had been. It was more like all rooms.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span>
<a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He had no feeling of the secrecy which the
great living-room gave him, and which irritated
him. He brushed his clothes and his
hair, and washed his hands and face. While
he was doing so he heard wheels and a horse&#39;s
fast trot. He guessed immediately that the
doctor had returned. He therefore, as soon
as he had completed the slight changes in his
toilet, started to return to the living-room.
Crossing the hall he met Doctor Gordon, who
seized him by the shoulder, and whispered in
his ear, "Not a word before Mrs. Ewing
about what happened this afternoon."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James nodded. "More mystery," thought
he with asperity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You have not spoken of it to her already,
I hope," said Doctor Gordon with quick
anxiety.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I have not. I have scarcely seen
her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, not a word, I beg of you. She is
very nervous."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The doctor had been removing his overcoat
and hat. When he had hung them on
some stag&#39;s horn in the hall, he went with
James into the living-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There, beside the fire, sat the girl in brown
whom James had met that afternoon on the
road.</p>
</div>

<hr class="page" />

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_3" id="toc_3"></a>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span>
<a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER II</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">She looked up when he entered, and there
was in her young girl face the very slightest
shade of recognition. She could not help it,
for Clemency was candor itself. Then she
bowed very formally, and shook hands sedately
when Doctor Gordon introduced James
as Doctor Elliot, his new assistant, and carried
off her part very well. James was not
so successful. He colored and was somewhat
confused, but nobody appeared to notice it.
Clemency went on relating how glad she was
that Uncle Tom met her as she was coming
home from Annie Lipton&#39;s. "I am never
afraid," said she, and her little face betrayed
the lie, "but I was tired, and besides I was
beginning to be cold, for I went out without
my fur."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You should not have gone without it. It
grows so cold when the sun goes down," said
Mrs. Ewing. Then a chime of Japanese bells
was heard which announced dinner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctor Elliot will be glad of dinner,"
<span class="tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span>
<a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said Doctor Gordon. "He has walked all the
way from Gresham."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency looked at him with approval, and
tried to look as if she had never seen him
walking in her life. "That is a good walk,"
said she. "Twenty-five miles it must be. If
more men walked instead of working poor
horses all the time, it would be better for
them."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That is a hint for your Uncle Tom," said
Gordon laughingly.</p>


<p class="tei tei-p">"I never hint," said Clemency. "It is
just a plain statement. Men are walking animals.
They could travel as well as horses in
the course of time if they only put their
minds to it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, your old uncle&#39;s bones must be
saved, even at the expense of the horse&#39;s,"
said Doctor Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Bones are improved by use," said Clemency
severely, as she took her seat at the dinner-table.
They all laughed. The girl herself
relaxed her pretty face with a whimsical
smile. It was quite evident that Clemency
was the spoiled and petted darling of the
house, and that she traded innocently upon
the fact. The young doctor, although his
first impression of the elder woman was still
<span class="tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span>
<a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>upon him, yet realized the charm of the
young girl. The older woman was, as it were,
crowned with an aureole of perfection, but
the young girl was crowned with possibilities
which dazzled with mystery. She looked
prettier, now that her outer garments were
removed, and her thick crown of ash-blonde
hair was revealed. The lamp lit her eyes
into bluer flame. She was a darling of a
young girl, and more a darling because she
had the sweetest confidence in everybody
thinking her one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">However, James Elliot, sitting in the well-appointed
dining-room, which was more like
a city house than a little New Jersey dwelling,
did not for a second retreat from his first
impression of Mrs. Ewing. Behind the coffee-urn
sat the woman with whom he had
not fallen in love, that was too poor a term to
use. He had become a worshipper. He felt
himself, body and soul, prostrate before the
Divinity of Womanhood itself. He realized
the grandeur of the abstract in the individual.
What was any spoiled, sweet young girl to
that? And Mrs. Ewing was, in truth, a wonderful
creature. She was a large woman
with a great quantity of blue-black hair,
which had the ripples one sees in antique
<span class="tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span>
<a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>statues. Her eyes, black at first glance, were
in reality dark blue. Her face gave one a
never-ending surprise. James had not known
that a woman could be so beautiful. Vague
comparisons with the Greek Helen, or Cleopatra,
came into his head. Now and then he
stole a glance at her. He dared not often.
She did not talk much, but he was rather
pleased with that fact, although her voice was
so sweet and gracious. Speech in a creature
like that was not an essential. It might even
be an excrescence upon a perfection. It did
not occur to the dazed mind of her worshipper
that Mrs. Ewing might have very simple and
ordinary reasons for not talking—that she
might be tired or ill, or preoccupied. But
after a number of those stolen glances, James
discovered with a great pang, as if one should
see for the first time that the arms of the
Venus were really gone, when his fancy had
supplied them, that the woman did not look
well. In spite of her beauty, there was ill-health
evident in her face. James was a
mere tyro in his profession as yet, but certain
infallible signs were there which he
could not mistake. They were the signs of
suffering, possibly of very great suffering.
She ate very little, James noticed, although
<span class="tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span>
<a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>she made a pretense of eating as much as
any one. James saw that Doctor Gordon
also noticed it. When the maid was taking
away Mrs. Ewing&#39;s plate, he spoke with a
gruffness which astonished the young man.
"For Heaven&#39;s sake, why don&#39;t you eat your
dinner, Clara?" said he. "Emma, replace
Mrs. Ewing&#39;s plate. Now, Clara, eat your
dinner." To James&#39;s utter astonishment,
Mrs. Ewing obeyed like a child. She ate
every morsel, although she could not restrain
her expression of loathing. When the
salad and dessert were brought on she ate
them also.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon watched her with what
seemed, to the young man, positive brutality.
His mouth under his heavy beard quivered
perceptibly whenever he looked at his sister
eating, his forehead became corrugated, and
his deep-set eyes sparkled. James was
heartily glad when dinner was over, and, at
Doctor Gordon&#39;s request, he followed him
into his office.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon&#39;s office was a small room at
the back of the house. It had an outer door
communicating with a path which led to the
stable. Two sides of the room were lined
with medical books, and two with bottles containing
<span class="tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span>
<a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>diverse colored mixtures. A hanging
lamp was over the center of a long table
in the middle of the room. Around it dangled
prisms, which cast rainbow colors over everything.
The first thing which struck one on
entering the room was the extraordinary
color scheme: the dull gleams of the books,
the medicine bottles which had lights like
jewels, and over all the flickers of prismatic
hues. The long table was covered with corks,
empty bottles, books, a medicine-case, and
newspapers, besides a mighty inkstand and
writing materials. There were also a box of
cigars, a great leather tobacco pouch, and,
interspersed among all, a multitude of pipes.
The doctor drew a chair beside this chaotic
table lit with rainbow lights, and invited
James to sit down. "Sit down a moment,"
he said. "Will you have a pipe or a cigar?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Cigar, please," replied James. The doctor
pushed the box toward him. James
realized immediately a ten-cent cigar at the
least when he began to smoke. Doctor Gordon
filled a pipe mechanically. His face still
wore the gloomy, almost fierce, expression
which it had assumed at table. He was a
handsome man in a rough, sketchy fashion.
His face was blurred with a gray grizzle of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span>
<a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beard. He wore his hair rather long, and he
had a fashion of running his fingers through
it, which made it look like a thick brush.
He dressed rather carelessly, still like a gentleman.
His clothes were slouchy, and needed
brushing, but his linen was immaculate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon smoked in silence, which his
young assistant was too shy to break. The
elder man finished his pipe, then he rose
with an impatient gesture and shook himself
like a great shaggy dog. "Come, young
man," said he, "we don&#39;t want to spend the
evening like this. Get your hat and coat."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James obeyed, and the two men left the
office by the outer door which opened on the
stable. As they came around by the front of
the house Clemency stood in the doorway.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Are you going out, you and Doctor Elliot,
Uncle Tom?" she called.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, dear; why?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Patients?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No; we are going down to Georgie K.&#39;s.
Tell your mother to go to bed at once."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When the two men were out in the street,
walking briskly in the keen frosty air, James
ventured a question. "Mrs. Ewing is not
well, is she?" he said. He fairly started at
the way in which his question was received.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span>
<a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Doctor Gordon turned upon him even fiercely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She is perfectly well, perfectly well,"
he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She does not look—" began James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When you are as old as I am you can
venture to diagnose on a woman&#39;s looks,"
said Gordon. "Clara is perfectly well."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James said no more. They walked on in
silence under a pale sky. Above a low mountain
range on their right was a faint light
which indicated the coming of the moon.
The ground was frozen in hard ridges.
James walked behind the doctor on the narrow
blue stone walk which served as sidewalk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This town has made no provision whatever
for courting couples," said Doctor Gordon
suddenly, and to James&#39;s astonishment
his whole manner and voice had changed. It
was far from gloomy. It was jocular even.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James laughed. "Yes, it would be difficult
for two to walk arm in arm, however loving,"
he returned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Just so," said the doctor, "and the funny
part of it is that this narrow sidewalk was intentional."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not for such a purpose?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Exactly so. It was given to the town by
<span class="tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span>
<a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a rich spinster who died about twenty years
ago. It was given in her will on condition
that it should not be more than two feet
wide."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"For that reason?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Just that reason. She had been jilted in
her youth, and her heart had been wrung
by the sight of her rival passing her very
window where she sat watching for her lover,
arm in arm with him. It was in summer, and
the dirt sidewalk was dry. She made up her
mind, then and there, that that sort of thing
should be prevented."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They had just reached a handsome old
house standing close to the narrow sidewalk.
In fact, its windows opened directly upon it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This is the house," the doctor said in corroboration.
James laughed, but he wondered
within himself if he were being told fish tales.
Doctor Gordon made him feel so very young
that he resented it. He resented it the more
when he realized the new glow of adoration
in his heart for that older woman whom they
had left behind. He began wondering about
her: how much older she was. He said to
himself that he did not care if she were old
enough to be his mother, his grandmother
even, there was no one in the whole world like
her.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span>
<a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then they came to the hotel, the Evarts
House. It was rather pretentious, well built,
with great columns in front supporting
double verandas. It was also well lighted.
It was evidently far above the usual order
of a road house. Doctor Gordon entered, with
James at his heels. They went into the great
low room at the right of the door, which was
the bar-room. Behind the bar stood an enormous
man, yellow haired and yellow bearded,
dispensing drinks. The whole low interior
was dim with tobacco smoke, and scented
with various liquors and spices. There was
on one side a great fireplace, in which stood
earthen pitchers, in which cider was being
mulled with red-hot pokers, eager vinous faces
watching. Nobody was intoxicated, but there
was a general hum of hilarity and gusto of
life about the place, an animal enjoyment of
good cheer and jollity. It was in truth not
respectable to get entirely drunk in Alton.
It was genteel to become "set up," exhilarated,
but the real gutter form of inebriety
was frowned upon to a much greater extent
than in many places where there was less
license.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hullo!" sang out Doctor Gordon as he
entered. Immediately a grin of comradeship
<span class="tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span>
<a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>overspread the pink face of the yellow-haired
giant behind the bar. "Hullo!" he responded.
"Just step into the other room,
and I&#39;ll be there right away."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James followed Doctor Gordon into what
was evidently the state parlor of the hotel.
There was haircloth furniture, and a mahogany
table, with various stains of conviviality
upon its polished surface. There was a fire
on the hearth, and on the mantel stood some
gilded vases and a glass case of wax-flowers,
also a stuffed canary under a glass shade,
pathetic on his little twig. Doctor Gordon
pointed to the flowers and the canary. "Poor
old man lost his wife, when he had been married
two years," he said. "She and the baby
both died. That was before I came here.
Damned if I wouldn&#39;t have pulled them
through. That was her bird, and she made
those fool flowers, poor little thing. I suppose
if the hotel were to take fire Georgie K.
would go for them before all the cash in the
till."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He hasn&#39;t married again?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Married again! It&#39;s my belief he&#39;d shoot
the man that mentioned it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then Georgie K. entered, his rosy face distended
with a smile of the most intense hospitality,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span>
<a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and before Doctor Gordon had a
chance to introduce James, he said, "What&#39;ll
you take, gentlemen?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This is my new assistant, from Gresham,
Doctor Elliot," said Gordon. Georgie K.
made a bow, and scraped his foot at the
same time with a curiously boyish gesture.
"What&#39;ll you take?" he asked again. That
was evidently his formula of hospitality,
which must never be delayed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Apple-jack," responded Doctor Gordon
promptly. "You had better take apple-jack
too, young man. Georgie K. has gin that beats
the record, and peach brandy, but when it
comes to his apple-jack—it&#39;s worth the whole
State of New Jersey."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All right," answered James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Soon he found himself seated at the stained
old mahogany table with the two men, and between
two glasses, a bottle, and a pitcher of hot
water. Doctor Gordon dealt a pack of dirty
cards while the hotel keeper poured the apple-jack.
James could not help staring at the
elder doctor with more and more amazement.
He seemed to assimilate perfectly with his
surroundings. The tormented expression had
gone from his face. He was simply convivial,
and of the same sort as Georgie K. He no
<span class="tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span>
<a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>longer looked even a gentleman. He had become
of the soil, the New Jersey soil. As
they drank and played, he told stories, and
roared with laughter at them. The stories
also belonged to the soil, they were folk lore,
wild, coarse, but full of humanity. Although
Doctor Gordon drank freely of the rich mellow
liquor, it did not apparently affect him.
His cheeks above his gray furze of beard became
slightly flushed, that was all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James drank rather sparingly. The stuff
seemed to him rather fiery, and he remembered
the goddess in the doctor&#39;s house. He
could imagine her look of high disdain at
him should he return under the influence of
liquor. Besides, he did not particularly care
for the apple-jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was midnight before they left. Georgie
K. went to the door with them, and he and
the doctor shook hands heartily. "Come
again," said Georgie K., "and the sooner
the better, and bring the young Doc. We&#39;ll
make him have a good time."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Until they were near home, Doctor Gordon
continued his strangely incongruous conversation,
telling story after story, and shouting
with laughter. When they came in sight of
the house Gordon stopped suddenly and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span>
<a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>leaned against a great maple beside the road.
He stared at the house, two of the upper windows
of which were lighted, and gave a great
sigh, almost a groan. James stopped also
and stared at him. He wondered if the apple-jack
had gone to the doctor&#39;s head after all.
"What is the matter?" he ventured.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing, except the race is at a finish,
and I am caught as I always am," replied
Doctor Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The race—" repeated James vaguely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, the race with myself. Myself has
caught up with me, God help me, and I am
in its clutches. The time may come when you
will try to race with self, my boy. Let me
tell you, you will never win. You will tire
yourself out, and make a damned idiot of
yourself for nothing. I shall race again to-morrow.
I never learn the lesson, but perhaps
you can, you are young. Well, come
along. Please be as quiet as you can when
you go into the house. My sister may be
asleep. She is perfectly well, but she is a
little nervous. I need not repeat my request
that you do not mention your adventure with
Clemency this afternoon to her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Certainly not," said James. He walked
on beside the doctor, and entered the house,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span>
<a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more and more mystified. James was not
sure, but he thought he heard the faintest
little moan from upstairs. He glanced at
Doctor Gordon&#39;s face, and it was again the
face of the man whom he had seen before
going to Georgie K.&#39;s.</p>

<a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER III</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next morning after breakfast, at which
Mrs. Ewing did not appear, Doctor Gordon
observed that she always took her rolls and
coffee in bed. James followed Doctor Gordon
into his office. Clemency, who had presided
at the coffee urn, had done so silently,
and looked, so James thought, rather sulky,
as if something had gone wrong. Directly
James was in the office, the doctor&#39;s man,
Aaron, appeared. He was a tall, lank Jerseyman,
incessantly chewing. His lean, yellow
jaws appeared to have acquired a permanent
rotary motion, but he had keen eyes of intelligence
upon the doctor as he gave his orders.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Put in the team," said Gordon. "We
are going to Haver&#39;s Corner. Old Sam Edwards
is pretty low, and I ought to have gone
there yesterday, but I didn&#39;t know whether
that child with diphtheria at Tucker&#39;s Mill
would live the day out. Now he has seen the
worst of it, thank the Lord! But to-day I
must go to Haver&#39;s. I want to make good
time, for there&#39;s something going on this
<span class="tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span>
<a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>afternoon, and I want an hour off if I can
get it." Again the expression of simple jocularity
was over the man&#39;s face, and James
remembered what he had said the night before
about again running a race with himself
the next day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After Aaron had gone out Gordon turned
to James. He pointed to his great medicine-case
on the table. "You might see to it that
the bottles are all filled," he said. "You will
find the medicines yonder." He pointed to the
shelf. "I have to speak to Clemency before
I go."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James obeyed. As he worked filling the
bottles he heard dimly Gordon&#39;s voice talking
to Clemency on the other side of the wall.
The girl seemed to be expostulating.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Doctor Gordon returned Aaron was
at his heels with an immense bottle containing
a small quantity of red fluid. "S&#39;pose
you&#39;ll want this filled?" he said to Gordon
with a grin which only disturbed for a second
his rotary jaws.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, yes, of course," replied Gordon, "we
want the aqua."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James stared at him as he poured a little
red-colored liquid from one of the bottles on
the shelves into the big one. "Now fill it up
<span class="tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span>
<a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from the pump, and put it in the buggy; be
sure the cork is in tight," he said to Aaron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon looked laughingly at James when
the man had gone. "I infer that you are
wondering what &#39;aqua&#39; may be," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I was brought up to think it was water,"
said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So it is, water pure and simple, with a
little coloring matter thrown in. Bless you,
boy, the people around here want their medicines
by the quart, and if they had them by
the quart, good-by to the doctor&#39;s job, and ho
for the undertaker! So the doctor is obliged
to impose upon the credulity of the avariciously
innocent, and dilute the medicine.
Bless you, I have patients who would accuse
me of cheating if I prescribed less than a cupful
of medicine at a time. They have to be
humored. After all, they are a harmless, good
lot, but stiffened with hereditary ideas, worse
than by rheumatism. If I should give a few
drops in half a glass of water, and order a
teaspoonful at a time, I should fly in the face
of something which no mortal man can conquer,
sheer heredity. The grandfathers and
great-grandfathers of these people took their
physic on draft, the children must do likewise.
Sometimes I even think the medicine
<span class="tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span>
<a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would lose its effect if taken in any other
way. Nobody can estimate the power of a
fixed idea upon the body. All the same, it is
a confounded nuisance carrying around the
aqua. I will confess, although I see the
necessity of yielding, that I have less patience
with men&#39;s stiff-necked stupidity than
I have with their sins."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James drove all the morning with Doctor
Gordon about the New Jersey country. It
was a moist, damp day, such as sometimes
comes even in winter. It was a dog day with
an atmosphere slightly cooler than that of
midsummer. Overcoats were oppressive,
the horses steamed. The roads were deep
with red mud, which clogged the wheels and
made the hoofs of the horses heavy. "It&#39;s
a damned soil," said Doctor Gordon. This
morning after appearing somewhat saturnine
at breakfast, he was again in his unnatural,
rollicking mood. He hailed everybody
whom he met. He joked with the patients
and their relatives in the farmhouses,
approached through cart-tracks of mire, and
fluttered about by chickens, quacking geese,
and dead leaves. Now and then, stately ranks
of turkeys charged in line of battle upon the
muddy buggy, and the team, being used to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span>
<a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it, stood their ground, and snorted contemptuously.
The country people were either
saturnine with an odd shyness, which had
something almost hostile in it, or they were
effusively hospitable, forcing apple-jack upon
the two doctors. James was much struck by
the curious unconcern shown by the relatives
of the patients, and even by the patients themselves.
In only one case, and that of a child
suffering from a bad case of measles, was
much interest evinced. The majority of the
patients were the very old and middle-aged,
and they discussed, and heard discussed, their
symptoms with much the same attitude as
they might have discussed the mechanism of
a wooden doll. If any emotion was shown it
was that of a singular inverted pride. "I
had a terrible night, doctor," said one old
woman, and a smirk of self-conceit was over
her ancient face. "Yes, mother <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">did</span> have an
awful night," said her married daughter with
a triumphant expression. Even the children
clustering about the doctor looked unconsciously
proud because their old grandmother
had had an awful night. The call of the two
doctors at the house was positively hilarious.
Quantities of old apple-jack were forced
upon them. The old woman in the adjoining
<span class="tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span>
<a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bedroom, although she was evidently suffering,
kept calling out a feeble joke in her
cackling old voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Those people seem positively elated because
that old soul is sick," said James when
he and the doctor were again in the buggy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They are," said Doctor Gordon, "even
the old woman herself, who knows well
enough that she has not long to live. Did
you ever think that the desire of distinction
was one of the most, perhaps the most, intense
purely spiritual emotion of the human
soul? Look at the way these people live here,
grubbing away at the soil like ants. The
most of them have in their lives just three
ways of attracting notice, the momentary
consideration of their kind: birth, marriage,
sickness and death. With the first they are
hardly actively concerned, even with the second
many have nothing to do. There are
more women than men as usual, and although
the women want to marry, all the men do not.
There remains only sickness and death for a
stand-by, so to speak. If one of them is really
sick and dies, the people are aroused to take
notice. The sick person and the corpse have
a certain state and dignity which they have
never attained before. Why, bless you, man,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span>
<a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>I have one patient, a middle-aged woman,
who has been laid up for years with rheumatism,
and she is fairly vainglorious, and so is
her mother. She brags of her invalid daughter.
If she had been merely an old maid on
her hands, she would have been ashamed of
her, and the woman herself would have been
sour and discontented. But she has fairly
married rheumatism. It has been to her as a
husband and children. I tell you, young man,
one has to have his little footstool of elevation
among his fellows, even if it is a mighty queer
one, or he loses his self-respect, and self-respect
is the best jewel we have."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They were now out in the road again, the
team plodding heavily through the red shale.
"It&#39;s a damned soil," said the doctor for the
second time. He looked down at the young
man beside him, and James again felt that resentful
sense of youth and inexperience. "I
don&#39;t know how you&#39;ve been brought up,"
said the elder man. "I don&#39;t want to infuse
heretic notions into your innocent mind."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James straightened himself. He tried to
give the other man a knowing look. "I have
been about a good deal," he said. "You need
not be afraid of corrupting <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">me</span>."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon laughed. "Well, I shall
<span class="tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span>
<a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not try," he said. "At least, I shall not mean
to corrupt you. I am a pessimist, but you
are so young that you ought not to be influenced
by that. Lord, only think what may be
before you. You don&#39;t know. I am so far
along that I know as far as I am concerned.
I did not know but you had been brought up
to think that whatever the Lord made was
good, and that in saying that this red, gluey
New Jersey soil was darned bad, I was swearing
the worst way. I don&#39;t want to have millstones
and that sort of thing about my neck.
I was quite up in the Scriptures at one time."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You need not be afraid," said James with
dignity; "I think the soil darned bad myself."
He hesitated a little over the darned,
but once it was out, he felt proud of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, it is," said Doctor Gordon, "and if
the Lord made it, he did not altogether succeed,
and I see no earthly way of tracing the
New Jersey soil back to original sin and the
Garden of Eden."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s so," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon&#39;s face grew sober, his jocular
mood for the time had vanished. He was
his true self. "Did it ever occur to you that
disease was the devil?" he asked abruptly.
"That is, that all these infernal microbes
<span class="tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span>
<a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that burrow in the human system to its disease
and death, were his veritable imps at
work?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James shook his head, and looked curiously
at his companion&#39;s face with its gloomy corrugations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, it has to me," said the doctor, "and
let me ask you one thing. You have been
brought up to believe that the devil&#39;s particular
residence was hell, haven&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James replied in a bewildered fashion that
he had.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well," said Doctor Gordon, "if the devil
lives here, as he must live, when there&#39;s such
failures in the way of soil, and such climates,
and such fiendish diseases, and crimes, why,
this is hell."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James stared at him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon nodded half-gloomily, half-whimsically.
"It&#39;s so," he said. "We call
it earth; but it&#39;s hell."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James said nothing. The doctor&#39;s gloomy
theology was too much for him. Besides, he
was not quite sure that the elder man was
not chaffing him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well," said Doctor Gordon presently,
"hell it is, but there are compensations, such
as apple-jack, and now and then there&#39;s something
<span class="tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span>
<a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>doing that amuses one even here. I am
going to take you to something that enlivens
hell this afternoon, if somebody doesn&#39;t send
a call. I am trying to get my work done this
morning, the worst of it, so as to have an hour
this afternoon."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The two returned a little after twelve, and
found luncheon waiting for them. Mrs. Ewing
took her place at the table, and James
thought that she did not look quite so ill as
she had done the evening before. She talked
more, and ate with some appetite. Doctor
Gordon&#39;s face lightened, not with the false
gayety which James had seen, but he really
looked quite happy, and spoke affectionately
to his sister.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you think, Tom," said she, "has
come over Clemency? I don&#39;t know when
there has been a morning that she has not
gone for a tramp, rain or shine, but she has
not stirred out to-day. She says she feels
quite well, but I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Clemency is all right," said Doctor
Gordon, but his face darkened again. As for
Clemency, she bent over her plate and looked
sulkier than ever. She fairly pouted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She can go out this afternoon," said Mrs.
Ewing. "It looks as if it were going to clear
off."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span>
<a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I don&#39;t want to go," said Clemency.
"I am all out of the humor of it." She spoke
with an air of animosity, as if somebody
were to blame, but when she saw Mrs. Ewing&#39;s
anxious eyes she smiled. "I would
much prefer staying with you, dear," she
said, "and finish Annie&#39;s Christmas present."
She spoke with such an affectionate
air, that James looked admiringly at her.
She seemed a fellow-worshipper. He thought
that he, too, would much prefer staying with
Mrs. Ewing than going with Doctor Gordon
on the mysterious outing which he had
planned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">However, directly after luncheon Gordon
led James out into the stable and called Aaron.
"Are they ready, Aaron?" inquired the doctor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron grinned, opened a rude closet, and
produced a number of objects, which James
recognized at once as dummy pigeons. So
Doctor Gordon was to take him to a pigeon-shooting
match. James felt a little disgusted.
He had, in fact, taken part in that sport with
considerable gusto himself, but, just now, he
being fairly launched, as it were, upon the
serious things of life, took it somewhat in
dudgeon that Doctor Gordon should think
<span class="tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span>
<a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to amuse him with such frivolities. But to
his amazement the elder man&#39;s face was all
a-quiver with mirth and fairly eager. "Show
the pigeons to Doctor Elliot, Aaron," said
Doctor Gordon. James took one of the rude
disks called pigeons from the hand of Aaron
with indifference, then he started and stared
at Doctor Gordon, who laughed like a boy,
fairly doubling himself with merriment.
Aaron did not laugh, he chewed on, but his
eyes danced.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, they are—" stammered James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Just so, young man," replied Doctor Gordon.
"They are wood. Aaron made them on
a lathe, and not a soul can tell them from the
clay pigeons unless they handle them. Now
you are going to see some fun. Jim Goodman,
who is the meanest skunk in town, has
cheated every mother&#39;s son of us first and
last, and this afternoon he is going to shoot
against Albert Dodd, and he&#39;s going to get his
finish! Dodd knows about it. He&#39;ll have
clay pigeons all right. Goodman has put up
quite a sum of money, and he stands fair to
lose for once in his life."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Come on, Aaron, put the bay mare in the
buggy. We&#39;ll drive down to the field. We
haven&#39;t got much time to spare."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span>
<a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron backed the mare out of her stall and
hitched her to the mud-bespattered buggy,
and the two men drove off with the wooden
pigeons under the seat. They had not far to
go, to a large field intersected with various
footpaths and with, a large bare space, which
evidently served as a football gridiron.
"This field is used like town property," explained
the doctor, "but the funny part of
it is, it belongs to an old woman who is, perhaps,
the richest person in Alton, and asks
such a price for the land that nobody can
buy it, and it has never occurred to her to
keep off trespassers. So everybody trespasses,
and she pays the taxes, and we are
all satisfied, especially as there are plenty of
better building sites in Alton to be bought for
less money. That old woman bites her nose
off every day, and never knows it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On this barren expanse, intersected with
the narrow footpaths, covered between with
the no color of last year&#39;s dry weeds and
grass, were assembled some half dozen men
and boys. They rushed up as the doctor&#39;s
buggy came alongside. "Got &#39;em?" they
cried eagerly. Doctor Gordon fumbled under
the seat and drew out the batch of wooden
pigeons, which one young fellow, who seemed
<span class="tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span>
<a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to be master of ceremonies, grasped and
rushed off with to the queer-looking machine
erected in the centre of the football clearing,
for the purpose of making them take wing.
The others went with him. Doctor Gordon
got out of his buggy, accompanied by James,
and they, too, joined the little group. "Got
the others?" asked Gordon in a half whisper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, you bet. We&#39;ve got the others all
right," said the young fellow, and everybody
laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Men and boys began to gather until the
field was half filled with them. They all wore
grinning countenances. "For Heaven&#39;s sake,
boys, don&#39;t act as if it were so awful funny,
or you&#39;ll spoil the whole thing," said the
young fellow who had come for the pigeons.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Only one face was entirely sober, even severe,
as with resolve, and that was the face
of a small, mean-looking man between forty
and fifty. He carried a gun, and looked at
once important and greedy. "That&#39;s Jim
Goodman," whispered Doctor Gordon to
James, "and he&#39;s a crack shot, too. Albert
isn&#39;t as sure, though he&#39;s pretty good, too."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James began to catch the spirit of it himself.
He felt at once disgusted and uneasy
about the doctor, but as for himself he was
<span class="tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span>
<a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only a young man, after all, and sport was
still sweet to his soul. He shouted with the
rest when the first pigeon was launched into
the air, and Albert Dodd, a tall, serious
young man, fired. He hit the bird, which at
once flew into fragments, as a clay pigeon
properly should.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Georgie K. came up and joined them. He
was evidently not in the secret, for he looked
intensely puzzled when Jim Goodman, who
had next shot, hit his bird fairly, but it
only hopped about and descended unbroken.
"What the deuce!" he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hush up, Georgie K.," said Doctor Gordon.
The other man turned and looked at
him keenly, but the doctor&#39;s imperturbable,
smiling face was on the sport. Georgie K.&#39;s
great pink face grew grave. Every time Albert
Dodd fired the pigeons dropped in pieces,
every time Jim Goodman fired they hopped as
if they were alive. Jim Goodman swore audibly.
He looked to his cartridges. The
whole field was in an uproar of mirth. The
gunshots were hardly audible for the yells
and wild halloos of merriment. The match
at last was finished. Jim Goodman&#39;s last
pigeon hopped, and he was upon it in a rage.
He took it up and examined it. It was riddled
<span class="tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span>
<a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with shot. He felt it, weighed it. Then his
face grew fairly black. From being only
mean, he looked murderous. He was losing
money, and money was the closest thing to
his soul. He looked around at the yelling
throng, one man at bay, and he achieved a
certain dignity, even in the midst of absurdity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This darned pigeon is wood," said he.
"They are all wood, all I have shot. This is
a put-up job! It ain&#39;t fair." He turned to
the young fellow who had taken the pigeons,
and who acted as referee.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"See here, John," he said, "you ain&#39;t
going to see me done this way, be you? You
know it ain&#39;t a fair deal. Albert Dodd&#39;s shot
clay pigeons, and I&#39;ve shot wood. It ain&#39;t
fair."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, it ain&#39;t fair," admitted the young fellow
reluctantly, with a side glance at Doctor
Gordon. Gordon made a movement, but
Georgie K. was ahead of him. James saw a
roll of bills pass from his hands to Jim
Goodman&#39;s. Gordon came up to Georgie K.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"See here!" he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well," replied Georgie K., without turning
his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Georgie K."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span>
<a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t stop. Excuse me, Doc." Georgie
K. jumped into a light wagon on that side of
the field, and was gone with a swift bounce
over the hollow which separated it from the
road. Doctor Gordon hurried back to his
own buggy, with James following, got in and
took the road after Georgie K. "He mustn&#39;t
pay that money," said Gordon. James said
nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I never thought of such a thing as that,"
said Doctor Gordon, driving furiously, but
they did not catch up with Georgie K. until
they reached the Evarts House, and he was
out of his wagon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon approached him, pocketbook
in hand. "See here, Georgie K.," he
said, "I owe you a hundred."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Owe me nothing," said Georgie K. It
had seemed impossible for his great pink face
to look angry and contemptuous, but it did.
"I don&#39;t set up for much," said he, "but I
must say I like a square deal."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Good Lord! so do I," said Gordon.
"Here, take this money. I had Aaron make
those darned wooden pigeons. Jim Goodman
has skinned enough young chaps here to
deserve the taste of a skin himself."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He ain&#39;t skinned you."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span>
<a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hasn&#39;t he? He owes me for two wives&#39;
last sicknesses, to say nothing of himself and
children, and he&#39;s living with his third, and I
shall have to doctor her for nothing or let her
die. But that wasn&#39;t what I did it for."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Georgie K. turned upon him. "What on
earth did you do it for, Doc?" said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Because I felt the way you have felt
yourself."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When the woman that made those wax-flowers,
and loved that little stuffed bird in
there, died."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Georgie K.&#39;s face paled. "What&#39;s the
matter, Doc?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing, I tell you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing. Who said there was anything?
I had to have my little joke. I tell you,
Georgie K., I&#39;ve <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">got</span> to have my little joke,
just as I&#39;ve got to have my game of euchre
with you and my glass of apple-jack; a man
can&#39;t be driven too far. I meant to make it
right with him. He&#39;s a mean little cuss, but
I am not mean. I intended to spend a hundred
on my joke, and you got ahead of me.
For God&#39;s sake, take the money, Georgie K."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Georgie K., still with a white, shocked, inquiring
<span class="tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span>
<a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>face, extended his hand and took the
roll of bills which the doctor gave him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Come in and take something," said he,
and Doctor Gordon and James accepted.
They went again into the state parlor on
whose shelf were the wax-flowers and the
stuffed canary, and they partook of apple-jack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then Doctor Gordon and James took leave.
Georgie K. gave Gordon a hearty shake of
the hand when he got into the buggy. Gordon
looked at James again with his gloomy
face, as he took up the lines. "Failed in the
race again," he said. "Now we&#39;ve got to
hustle, for I have eight calls to make before
dinner, and it&#39;s late. I ought to change
horses, but there isn&#39;t time."</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER IV</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The weeks went on, and James led the
same life with practically no variation. The
sense of a mystery or mysteries about the
house never left him, and it irritated him.
He was not curious; he did not in the least
care to know in what the mystery consisted,
but the fact of concealment itself was obnoxious
to him. As for himself, he never
concealed anything, and when it came to
mystery, he had a vague idea of something
shameful, if not criminal. Doctor Gordon&#39;s
incomprehensible changes of mood, of almost
more than mood, of character even, disturbed
him. Why a man should be one hour
a country buffoon, the next an absorbed gentleman,
he could not understand. And he
could not understand also why Clemency had
never left the house since he had met her on
the day of his arrival. She evidently was
herself angry and sulky at being housed, but
she did not attempt to resist, and whenever
Mrs. Ewing expressed anxiety about her
health, she laughed it off, and made some
<span class="tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span>
<a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>excuse, such as the badness of the roads, or
some Christmas work which she was anxious
to finish. However, at last Mrs. Ewing&#39;s concern
grew so evident that Doctor Gordon at
dinner one day gave what seemed a plausible
reason for Clemency remaining indoors. "If
you will have it, Clara," he said, "Clemency
has a slight pain in her side, and pleurisy
and pneumonia are all about, and I told her
that she had better take no chances, and the
weather has been raw."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Ewing turned quite white. "Oh,
Tom," she murmured, "why didn&#39;t you tell
me?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I did not tell you, Clara dear, because
you would immediately have had the child in
a galloping consumption, and it is really
nothing at all. I only want to be on the safe
side."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is a very little pain, mother dear,"
said Clemency. When Clemency spoke to
Mrs. Ewing, her voice had a singing quality.
At such times, although the young man&#39;s
very soul was possessed of the mother, he
could not help viewing the daughter with favor.
But he was puzzled about the pleurisy.
The girl seemed to him entirely well, although
she was losing a little of her warm
<span class="tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span>
<a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>color from staying indoors. Still, after all,
a pain is as invisible as a spirit. Her friend,
Annie Lipton, spent a few days with her,
and then James saw very little of Clemency.
The two girls sat together in Clemency&#39;s
room, and only the Lord of innocence and ignorance
knew what they talked about. They
talked a great deal. James, whenever he was
in the house, was conscious of the distant
murmur of their sweet young voices, although
he could not distinguish a word. Annie
Lipton was a prettier girl than Clemency,
though without her personal charm. Her
beauty seemed to abash her, and make her
indignant. She was a girl who should have
been a nun, and viewed love and lovers from
behind iron bars. She treated James with exceeding
coolness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Annie Lipton is an anomaly," Doctor
Gordon remarked once over his after-dinner
pipe, when they sat in the study listening
to the feminine murmur on the other side of
the wall. It sounded like the gentle ripple of
a summer sea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why?" returned James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She defies her sex," replied Doctor Gordon,
"and still there is nothing mannish about
her. She is a woman angry and ashamed at
<span class="tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span>
<a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her womanhood. If she ever marries, it will
be at the cost of a terrible mental struggle.
There are women-haters among men, and
there are a very few—so few as to rank with
albinos and white blackbirds in scarcity—man-haters
among women. Annie is a man-hater."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She is very pretty, too," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If you attempt the conquest, I&#39;ll warn
you there will be scaling ladders and all the
ancient paraphernalia of siege needed," said
Doctor Gordon laughingly. James colored.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It may be that I am a woman-hater," he
replied, and looked very young. Doctor Gordon
again laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A little later they went to Georgie K.&#39;s.
They went nearly every evening while Annie
Lipton was with Clemency. After she had
left they did not go so often. "It is pretty
dull for Clemency," Doctor Gordon would
say, and they would remain at home and
play whist with the two ladies. James began
to be quite sure that Doctor Gordon&#39;s
visits to Georgie K.&#39;s were mostly made when
Mrs. Ewing looked worse than usual and did
not eat her dinner. James became convinced
in his own mind that Mrs. Ewing was not
well, although he never dared broach the subject
<span class="tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span>
<a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>again to the doctor, and although it made
no difference whatever in his own attitude toward
her. As well might he have turned his
back upon the Venus, because of some slight
abrasion which her beautiful body had received
from the ages.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But one day, having come in unexpectedly
alone, he found her on the divan in the living-room,
evidently weeping, and his heart went
out to her. He flung himself down on his
knees beside her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, what is it? What is the matter?"
he whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her whole body was writhing. She uncovered
her eyes and looked at him pitifully,
and yet with a certain dignity. Those beautiful
eyes, brimming with tears, were not reddened,
and their gaze was steady. "If I tell
you, will you keep my secret?" she whispered
back, "or, rather, it is not a secret since Doctor
Gordon knows it. I wish he did not, but
will you keep your knowledge from him?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I promise you I will," said James fervently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am terribly ill," said Mrs. Ewing simply.
"I suffer at times tortures. Don&#39;t ask
me what the matter is. It is too dreadful,
and although I have no reason to feel so, it
<span class="tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span>
<a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seems to me ignominious. I am ashamed of
being so ill. I feel disgraced by it, wicked."
She covered her face again and sobbed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t, don&#39;t," said James, out of his
senses completely. "Don&#39;t, I can&#39;t bear it.
I love you so. Don&#39;t! I will cure you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You cannot. Doctor Gordon does not
admit that my case is hopeless, but he gives
no hope, and you must have noticed how he
suffers when he sees me suffer. He runs away
from me because he can do nothing to help
me. That is the worst of it all. I could bear
the pain for myself, but for the others, too!
Oh, I wish there was some little back door of
life out of which one could slip, and no blame
to anybody, in a case like this. But there is
nothing but the horrible front door, which
means such agony to everybody who is left,
as well as the one that goes." Mrs. Ewing
had completely lost control of herself. She
sobbed again and moaned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James covered one of her cold hands with
kisses. "Don&#39;t, don&#39;t," he begged. "Don&#39;t,
I love you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly Mrs. Ewing came to the comprehension
of what he said. She looked at his
bent head—James had a curly head like a
boy&#39;s—and a strange look came into her eyes,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span>
<a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as if she were regarding him across an immeasurable
gulf. Nobody had ever seemed
quite so far away in the world as this boy
with his cry of love to the woman old enough
to be his mother. It was not the fact of her
superior age alone, it was her disease, it was
her sense of being done forever with anything
like this that gave her, as it were, a view of
earth from outside, and yet she had a sense
of comfort. James was even weeping. She
felt his tears on her hand. It did her good
that anybody could love her so little as to be
able to stay by and see her suffer, and weep
for her, and not rush forth in a rage of misery
like Thomas Gordon. In a second, however,
she had command of herself. She drew her
hand away. "Doctor Elliot," she said, "you
forget yourself."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, no, I don&#39;t," protested James. "It
is not as if I—I were thinking of you in that
way. I am not. I know you could not possibly
think of me as a girl might. It is only
because I love you. I have never seen anybody
like you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must put me out of your head," said
Mrs. Ewing. "I am old enough to be your
mother; I am ill unto death. You must not
love me in any way."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span>
<a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I cannot help it"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Ewing hesitated. "I have a mind to
tell you something," she said in a low voice.
"Can I rely upon you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I would die before I told, if you said I
was not to," cried James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It might almost come to that," said the
woman gravely. "A very serious matter is
involved, otherwise there would not be this
secrecy. I cannot tell you what the matter
is, but I can tell you something which will
cure you of loving me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t want to be cured," protested
James, "and I have told you it is a love like
worship, it is not—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Ewing interrupted him. "The worship
of a young man is not to be trusted,"
she said. "I cannot have you made to suffer.
I will tell you, but, remember, if you betray
me you will do awful harm. Neither the doctor
nor Clemency even must know that I tell
you. The doctor knows, of course, the secret;
Clemency does not know, and must never
know. It would be the undoing of all of us,
the terrible undoing, if this were to get out,
but I will tell you. You are a good boy, and
you shall be spared needless pain. Listen."
She leaned forward and whispered close to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span>
<a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his ear. James started back, and stared at
her as white as death. Mrs. Ewing smiled.
"It hurts a little, I know," she said, "but
better this now than worse later. You are
foolish to feel so about me; you were at a disadvantage
in coming here. It is only right
that you should know. Now never speak to
me again about this. Think of me as your
friend, and your friend who is in very great
suffering and pain, and have sympathy for
me, if you can, but not so much sympathy
that you too will suffer. I want sympathy,
but not agony like poor Tom&#39;s. That makes
it harder for me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Does she know?" asked James, half-gasping.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You mean does Clemency know I am
ill?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She knows I am ill. She does not know
how terrible it is. You must help me to keep
it from her. I almost never give way when
she is present. I knew she was taking a nap
this afternoon, and the pain was so awful.
It is better now. I think I will go to my
room and lie down for a while." Mrs. Ewing
rose, and extended her hand to James.
"I have forgotten already what you told
me," she said.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span>
<a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can never forget!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must, or you must go away from
here."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can never forget, but it shall be a thing
of the past," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That is right," Mrs. Ewing said with a
maternal air. "It will only take a little effort.
You will see."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She went out of the room with a flounce of
red draperies, and left James. He sat down
beside a window and stared out blankly. The
thought came to him, how many avowals of
love and deathless devotion such a woman
must have listened to. Her manner of receiving
his made him think that there had been
many. "It is quite proper," he thought to
himself. "A woman like that is born to be
worshiped." Then he thought of what she
had told him, and a sort of rage filled his
heart. He recognized the fact that she had
been right in her estimation of the worship
of a young man. He is always trying to turn
his idol into clay.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The door opened and Clemency entered,
but he did not notice it. She came and sat
down in front of him, and looked angrily at
him, then for the first time he saw her. He
rose. "I beg your pardon, I did not hear
you come in," he said.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span>
<a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sit down again," said Clemency pettishly.
"Don&#39;t be silly. I am used to having young
men not see anybody but my mother when
she comes into a room, and it is quite right,
too. I don&#39;t think there ever was a woman
so beautiful as she, do you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I don&#39;t," replied James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency eyed him keenly. Then she
blushed at the surmise which came to her,
and James also blushed at the knowledge of
the surmise. "You can&#39;t be much older
than I am. I am twenty-three," said Clemency
after a while. Then the red suffused
her very throat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am twenty-three, too," said James.
Then he added bluntly, for he began to be
angry, "A man can think a woman the most
beautiful he ever saw without—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, I didn&#39;t think you were such a fool,"
said Clemency; then she added, in a meek
and shamed voice, "I should have been awfully
disgusted with you if you had not
thought my mother the most beautiful woman
you ever saw, and I am used to men not seeing
me. I don&#39;t want them to. I think I feel
something as Annie Lipton does about men.
She says she feels as if she wanted to kill
<span class="tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span>
<a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>every man who looks at her as if he loved
her. I think I should, too."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Miss Lipton has a great many admirers,"
remarked James by way of changing the subject.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, yes, every young man for miles
around, ever since she was grown up. She
doesn&#39;t like any of them." Clemency looked
at James with sudden concern. "I am going
to tell you something," she said, "even if it
is rather betraying confidence. I think I
ought to. Annie told me she had taken a
great dislike to you, from the very first moment
she saw you, so it would be no use—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am sorry," replied James stiffly, "but
as I had no particular feeling for her, except
admiration of her beauty, it makes no especial
difference."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I thought, of course, you would fall in
love with her," said Clemency. Then she
added, with most inexplicable inverted jealousy,
"You must have very poor taste, or
you would. You are the first one."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Some one has to be first," James said,
laughing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know but I was horrid to tell you
what I did," said Clemency, looking at him
doubtfully.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span>
<a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t thing it as horrid for a girl to
assume that every man is in love with her
friend as it would be if she assumed something
else," said James. He knew that his
speech was ungallant; but it seemed to him
that this girl fairly challenged him to rudeness.
But she looked at him innocently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, no, I never should think that," said
she. "Being with two women so very beautiful
as my mother and Annie so much
makes me quite sure that nobody is thinking
of me. It is only sometimes that I feel
a little like a piece of furniture, only chairs
can&#39;t walk into rooms." She ended with a
girlish laugh. Then her face suddenly sobered.
"Doctor Elliot, I want you to tell
me something," said she. "Uncle Tom
wouldn&#39;t if I asked him, and I don&#39;t dare
ask him anyway. Do you think mother is
very well?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James hesitated. "You ought to tell me,"
Clemency said imperatively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have thought sometimes that she did
not look quite well," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you think the matter is?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It may be indigestion."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you think it is?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know. Doctor Gordon has told
<span class="tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span>
<a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>me nothing, and Mrs. Ewing has told me
nothing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I thought doctors could tell from a person&#39;s
looks."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not always."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctors aren&#39;t much good anyhow," said
Clemency. "I don&#39;t care if you are one, and
Uncle Tom is one. I notice people die just
the same. So you think it is indigestion?
Well, it may be. Mother doesn&#39;t have much
appetite."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I have noticed that," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then there is something else I want to
ask you," said Clemency. "I have a right
to know if you know. What does Uncle Tom
make me stay in the house so for?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know," replied James, looking
honestly at her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t you, honest? Hasn&#39;t he told
you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course, I know the first of it came
from my meeting that man the day you came
here, but it does seem such utter nonsense
that I have to stay housed this way. I never
met a man that frightened me before, and it
is not likely that I shall again. It does not
stand to reason that that man is hanging
<span class="tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span>
<a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>around here waiting to intercept me again.
It is nonsense, but Uncle Tom won&#39;t let me
stir out. He has even ordered me to keep
away from the windows, and be sure that the
curtains are drawn at night. I don&#39;t know
what the matter is. I can&#39;t say a word about
it to mother, she is so nervous. I have to
pretend that I like to stay in the house, and
some days I really think I am going mad for
fresh air. Uncle Tom won&#39;t even let me go
driving with him. So you don&#39;t know anything
about it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing whatever."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I can&#39;t stand it much longer," said
Clemency with an obstinate look. "As for
the pain in my side, that&#39;s an awful lie; I
haven&#39;t the ghost of a pain. I can&#39;t stand it
much longer. Here&#39;s Uncle Tom. You are
not going to tell him I said anything about
it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course, I am not," answered James.
He began to feel that he was entangled in a
web of secrecy, and his feeling of irritation
increased. He would have gotten out of it
and spent Christmas at his own home, but
Doctor Gordon had an unusual number of
patients suffering from grippe, and pneumonia
was almost epidemic, and he felt that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span>
<a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he should not leave. It was the second week
of the new year when James, returning from
a call at a near-by patient, whither he had
walked, found Mrs. Ewing in the greatest
distress. It was ten o&#39;clock at night, and she
was pacing the living-room. Immediately
when he entered she ran to him. "Oh," she
gasped, "Clemency, Clemency!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, what is it?" asked James. Clemency
had not been at the dinner-table, but he
had supposed her sulking, as she had been
doing of late, and that she had taken advantage
of Doctor Gordon&#39;s absence at a distant
patient&#39;s to remain away from the table.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She begged so hard to go out, and said
the pain was quite well," gasped Mrs. Ewing,
"that I said she might go and see Annie, and
here it is ten o&#39;clock at night, and Tom has
gone to Grover&#39;s Corner, and may not be
home until morning, and Aaron is with him,
and I had no one to send. I thought I would
not say anything to you. I thought every
minute she would come in, and Emma has
walked half a mile looking for her, and I am
horribly worried."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I will go directly and look for her," said
James. "I will put the bay in the light
buggy, and drive to Westover. Don&#39;t worry.
I&#39;ll bring her back in half an hour."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span>
<a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The bay is so lame she can&#39;t travel, I
heard Tom say this morning," said Mrs. Ewing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then I&#39;ll take the gray."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She balks, you know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James laughed. "Oh, I&#39;ll risk the balking,"
he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He hurried out to the stable and put the
gray in the buggy. It was a very short time
before James was on the road, and the gray
went as well as could be desired, but just before
she reached Westover she stopped short,
and James might as well have tried to move
a mountain as that animal with her legs
planted at four angles of relentless obstinacy.</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER V</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">James had considerable experience with,
horses. He knew at once that it was probably
a hopeless undertaking to change the
mare&#39;s mind, or rather her obstinacy. However,
he tried the usual methods, touching
with the whip, getting out and attempting to
lead, but they were all, as he had supposed
from the first, in vain. A terrible sense of
being up against fate itself seized him: an
animal&#39;s will unreasoning, unrelenting, bears,
in fact, the aspect of fate itself. It is at
once sensate and insensate. James thought
of Clemency, and decided to waste no more
time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The gray mare was near enough to a tree
to tie her, and he tied her and set out on foot.
It was a very dark night, cloudy and chilly
and threatening snow. He walked on, as it
were, through softly enveloping shadows,
which seemed to his excited fancy to be coming
forward to meet him. He began to be
very much alarmed. He had wasted most
of his young sentiment upon Clemency&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span>
<a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mother, but, after all, he suddenly discovered
that he had a feeling for the girl herself.
He thought that it was only the natural anxiety
of any man of honor for the safety of
a helpless young girl out alone at night, and
beset by possible dangers, but he realized
himself in a panic. His plan was of course
to go directly to Annie Lipton&#39;s home, some
two miles farther on, then it occurred to
him that Clemency must inevitably have
left there. If she were lying dead or injured
on the road, how in the world was he
to see? He felt in his pocket for matches,
and found just one. He lit that and peered
around. While it burned he saw nothing
except the frozen road with its desolate
borders of woods and brush, a fit scene for
countless tragedies. When the match burned
out he thought of something else. Supposing
that Clemency were lying half-dead anywhere
near the road, how was she to know
that a friend was near? Immediately he began
to whistle. Whistling was a trick of
his, and he had a remarkably sweet, clear
pipe. He knew that Clemency, if she were
to hear his whistle, would know who was
near. He whistled "Way down upon the
Suwanee River" through, then he began on
<span class="tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span>
<a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the "Flower Song" from Faust, walking all
the time quite rapidly but with alert ears. He
was half through the "Flower Song" when
he stopped short. He thought he heard something.
He listened, and did hear quite distinctly
an exceedingly soft little voice, which
might have been the voice of shadows—"Is
that you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency," he cried out, and rushed toward
the wood, and directly the girl was clinging
to him. She was panting with sobs, but
she kept her voice down to a whisper. "Speak
low, speak low," she said in his ear. "I
don&#39;t know where he is. Oh, speak low."
She clung to him with almost a spasmodic
grip of her slender arms. "If you had been
ten minutes longer I think I should have
died," she whispered. "Don&#39;t make a sound.
I don&#39;t know where he is."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was it—" began James. He felt himself
trembling at the thought of what the girl
might be going to reveal to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, that same dreadful man. Uncle
Tom was right. I stayed too long at Annie&#39;s.
It was almost dark when I left there. She
persuaded me to stay to dinner. They had
turkey. I was about half a mile below here
when he, the man, came out of the woods,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span>
<a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>just as he did before. I heard him, and I
knew. I did not look around. I ran, and I
heard his footsteps behind me. The darkness
seemed to shut down all at once. I knew
he could catch me, and remembered what I
had heard about wild animals when they
were hunted. I had gone a little past here,
running just as softly as I could, when I
turned right into the woods, and ran back.
Then I lay right down in the underbrush
and kept still. I heard him run past. Then
I heard him come back. He came into the
woods. I expected every minute he would
step on me, but I kept still. Finally I heard
him go away, but I have not dared to stir
since! I made up my mind I would keep
still until I heard a team pass. It did seem
to me one must pass, and one would have at
any other time, but it has been hours I have
been lying there. Then I heard your whistle.
I was almost afraid to speak then. Don&#39;t
speak above a whisper now. Did you come
on foot?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I had the gray mare, and she balked about
half a mile from here. You are sure you are
not hurt?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, only I am trying hard not to faint.
Let us walk on very fast, but step softly, and
don&#39;t talk."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span>
<a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">James put his arm around the girl and
half carried her. She continued to draw
short, panting breaths, which she tried to
subdue. They reached the place where the
gray mare loomed faintly out of the gloom
with the dark mass of the buggy behind her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Let us get in," whispered Clemency.
"Quick!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am afraid she won&#39;t budge."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, she will for me. She has a tender
mouth, that is why she balks. You must
have pulled too hard on the lines. Sometimes
I have made her go when even Uncle Tom
couldn&#39;t."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency ran around to the gray&#39;s head
and patted her, and James untied her. Then
the girl got into the buggy and took the reins,
and James followed. He was almost jostled
out, the mare started with such impetus. They
made the distance home almost on a run.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, I am so glad," panted Clemency.
"You see I can seem to feel her mouth when
I hold the lines, and she knows. Was poor
mother worried?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A little."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know she was almost crazy."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She will be all right when she sees you
safe," said James.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span>
<a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Is Uncle Tom home yet? No, of course
I know he isn&#39;t, or he would have come instead
of you. Oh, dear, I know he will scold
me. I shall have to tell him, but I mustn&#39;t
tell mother about the man. What shall I tell
her? It is dreadful to have to lie, but sometimes
one would rather run the risk of fire
and brimstone for one&#39;s self than have anybody
else hurt. If I tell mother she will
have one of her dreadful nervous attacks.
I can&#39;t tell her. What shall I tell her, Doctor
Elliot?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think the simplest thing will be to say
that Miss Lipton persuaded you to stay to
supper, and so you were late, and I overtook
you," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mother will never believe that I stayed
so long as that," said Clemency. "I shall
have to lie more than that. I don&#39;t know
exactly what to say. I could have Charlie
Horton come in to play whist, and be taking
me home in his buggy. He always drives,
and you could meet me on the road."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, you could do that."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is a very complicated lie," said Clemency,
"but I don&#39;t know that a complicated
lie is any worse than a simple one. I think
I shall have to lie the complicated one. You
<span class="tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span>
<a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>need not say anything, you know. You can
take the mare to the stable, and I will run
in and get the lie all told before you come.
You won&#39;t lie, will you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James could not help laughing. "No, I
don&#39;t see any need of it," he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is rather awful for you to have to live
with people who have to lie so," remarked
Clemency, "but I don&#39;t see how it can be
helped. If you had seen my mother in one
of her nervous attacks once, you would never
want to see her again. There is only one
thing, I do feel very weak still, and I am
afraid I shall look pale. Hold the lines a
minute. Don&#39;t pull on them at all. Let them
lie on your knees."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What are you doing?" asked James when
he had complied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doing? I am pinching my cheeks almost
black and blue, so mother won&#39;t notice.
I don&#39;t talk scared now, do I?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not very."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I think I can manage that. I think
I can manage my voice. I am all over being
faint. Oh, I will tell you what I will do. You
haven&#39;t got your medicine-case with you, have
you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I started so hurriedly."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span>
<a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I will go in the office way. I know
where Uncle Tom keeps brandy, and I will be
so chilled that I&#39;ll have to take a little before
mother sees me. That will make me all right.
I wouldn&#39;t take it for myself, but I will for
her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And you are chilled, all right," said
James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I think I am," said Clemency. "I
did not think of it, but I guess it was cold
there in the woods keeping still so long."
Indeed, the girl was shaking from head to
foot, both with cold and nervous terror. "It
was awful," she said in a little whisper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt the girl shaking from head to
foot. Suddenly a great tenderness for the
poor, little hunted thing came over him. He
put his arm around her. "Poor little soul,"
he said. "It must have been terrible for
you lying out there in the cold and dark and
not knowing—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency shrank into his embrace as a
hurt child might have done. "It was perfectly
terrible," she said, with a little sob.
"I didn&#39;t know but he might come back any
minute and find me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is all over now," James said soothingly.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span>
<a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, for the time," Clemency replied
with a little note of despair in her voice, "but
there is something about it all that I don&#39;t
understand. Only think how long I have
had to stay in the house, and he must have
been on the watch. I don&#39;t know when it is
ever going to end."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think that I will end it to-morrow,"
said James with fierce resolution.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You? How?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am going to put a stop to this. If an
innocent girl can&#39;t step out of the house for
weeks at a time without being hounded this
way, it is high time something was done. I
am going to get a posse of men and scour the
country for the scoundrel."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, will you do that?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I will. It is high time somebody
did something."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You saw him. You know just how he
looks?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I could tell him from a thousand."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency drew a long breath. "Well,"
she said doubtfully, "if you can, but—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But what?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing, only somehow I doubt if Uncle
Tom will think it advisable. There must be
some mystery about all this or Uncle Tom
<span class="tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span>
<a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>himself would have done that very thing at
first. I don&#39;t understand it. But I don&#39;t
believe Uncle Tom will consent to your hunting
for the man. I think for some reason he
wants it kept secret." Suddenly, Clemency
gave a passionate little outcry. "Oh, how
I do hate secrets!" she said. "How I have
always hated them! I want everything right
out, and here I seem to be in a perfect snarl
of secrets! I wonder how long I shall have
to stay in the house."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Perhaps you are wrong, and your uncle
will take measures now this has happened
for the second time," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, he won&#39;t," replied the girl hopelessly.
"I am almost sure that he will
not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency was right. After she had made
her entry and told her little lie successfully,
and explained that she had taken some brandy
because she was chilled, and Mrs. Ewing had
gently scolded her for staying so late, and
kissed and embraced her, and gotten back
her own composure, Doctor Gordon arrived,
and James, who had waited for him in the
study, told him the story in whispers. "Now
I think you had better let me get a posse of
men and scour the country to-morrow," he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span>
<a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>concluded. "It seems to me that this thing
has gone far enough."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon sat huddled up before him
in an arm-chair. He had not even taken off
his overcoat, which was white with snow.
The storm had begun. "It will be easy to
track him on account of the snow," added
James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tracking is not necessary," replied Gordon,
with his haggard face fixed upon James.
"I know exactly where the man is, and have
known from the first."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then—" began James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You don&#39;t know what you are talking
about," Gordon said gloomily. "I would
have that fiend arrested to-morrow. I would
have him hung from the nearest tree if I had
my way, but I can do absolutely nothing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I can do nothing, except what I have
been doing, so far in vain, it seems, to try to
tire him out. I traded too much on his impatience,
it seemed. I did not think he would
have held out so long."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You mean you will have to keep that poor
little thing shut up the way you have been
doing?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I see no other way. God knows I have
tried to think of another, day and night."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span>
<a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t see why you or I could not take
her out sometimes when we visit patients anyway,"
said James in a bewildered fashion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You don&#39;t understand," replied Doctor
Gordon irritably. "The main point is: the
girl must not be even seen by that man.
That is the trouble. Driving, she might be
perfectly safe; in fact, in one way she is safe
anyhow. She is not in any danger of bodily
harm, as you may think, but I don&#39;t want
her seen."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why not let me take her out sometimes
of an evening then?" said James, more and
more mystified. "If she wore a veil, and
went out driving in the evening, I can&#39;t see
how anybody could get a glimpse of her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You don&#39;t understand that we have to
deal with a very devil incarnate," said Doctor
Gordon wearily. "He will be on the
watch for just that very man&#339;uvre. However,
perhaps we may be able to manage that;
I will see."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She will be ill if she remains in the house
so closely," said James, "especially a girl
like her, who has been accustomed to lead
such an outdoor life. In fact, I don&#39;t think
she does look very well now. It is telling on
her."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span>
<a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I think it is," agreed Doctor Gordon
gloomily, "but again, I say, I see no
other way out of it. However, perhaps you
or I can take her out sometimes of an evening.
I suppose it had better be you, on some
accounts. I will see. Well, I will take off
my coat and get something to eat. I suppose
Clara and Clemency have gone to bed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They went hours ago," replied James.
It was, in fact, two in the morning. James
followed the doctor, haggard and weary, into
the kitchen, where, according to custom at
such times, some dinner had been left to keep
warm on the range. "I&#39;ll sit down here,"
said Doctor Gordon. "It is warmer than in
the dining-room, and I am chilled through.
If you don&#39;t mind, Elliot, I wish you would
get me a bottle of apple-jack from the dining-room.
I must have something to hearten
me up, or I shall go by the board, and I don&#39;t
know what will become of her—of them."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James sat and waited while the doctor ate
and drank. When he had finished he looked
a little less haggard. He stretched himself
before the warm glow from the range and
laughed. "Now I feel my fighting blood is
up again," he said. "After all, if there is
anything in the Good Book, the wicked shall
<span class="tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span>
<a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not always triumph, and I may win out. I
shall do my best anyhow. But I confess you
took the wind out of me with what you told
me when I came in. I am glad Clara does
not know. Poor little Clemency having to
pave her way with lies, but it would kill
Clara. Oh, God, it does seem as if I had
enough before. Take my advice, young man,
and try to think more of yourself than anybody
else in the world. Don&#39;t let your heart
go out to anybody. Just as sure as you do,
the door of the worst torture-chamber in
creation swings open. The minute you become
vulnerable through love, you haven&#39;t a
strong place in your whole armor."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What a doctrine!" observed James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know it, but I have taken a fancy to
you, boy; and hang it if I want you to suffer
as I have to."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But a man would not be a man at all if
he did not think enough of somebody to suffer,"
said James, and now he was thinking
of poor little Clemency, and how she had
nestled up to him for protection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Maybe," said Doctor Gordon gloomily,
"but sometimes I wonder whether it pays
in the long run to be what you call a man.
Sometimes I wish that I were a rock or a tree.
I do to-night."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span>
<a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You will feel better after you have had
a little sleep," James said, as the two men
rose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly one of Doctor Gordon&#39;s inexplicable
changes of mood came over him.
He laughed. "If it were not so late we
would go down to Georgie K.&#39;s," said he.
"I never felt more awake. Well, I guess
it&#39;s too late. You must be dead tired yourself.
I have not thanked you at all for your
rescue of the girl. She would have been down
with a serious illness if you had not gone, for
she would have lain in that place being snowed
over until somebody came."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She was mighty clever to do what she
did," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, she is clever," returned Doctor Gordon.
"She is a good girl, and it stings me
to the very heart that she has to suffer such
persecution. Well, &#39;all&#39;s well that ends well.&#39;
Did it ever occur to you that God made up to
mankind for the horrors of creation, by stating
that there would be an end to it some day?
Good God, if this terrible world had to roll
on to all eternity!" Doctor Gordon laughed
again his unnatural laugh. "Fancy if you
were awakened to-night by the last trump,"
he said. "How small everything would
<span class="tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span>
<a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seem. Hang it, though, if I wouldn&#39;t try to
have a hand at that man&#39;s finish before the
angel of the Lord got his flaming sword at
work."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James looked at him with terror.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t mind me, boy," said Gordon. "I
don&#39;t mean to blaspheme; but Job is not in
it with me just now. You cannot imagine
what I had to contend with before this
melodramatic villain appeared on the stage.
Sometimes I think this is the finish," Gordon&#39;s
mouth contracted. He looked savage.
James continued to stare at him. Gordon
laid his hand on James&#39;s shoulder. "Thank
the Lord for one thing," he said almost tenderly,
"that he sent you here. Between us
we will take care of poor little Clemency
anyhow. Now go to bed, and go to sleep."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James obeyed as to the one, but he could
not as to the other. He became, as the hours
wore on, so nervous that he was half-inclined
to take a sleeping powder. The room seemed
full of flashes of lightning. He heard sounds
which made him cold with horror. He was
highly strung nervously, and was really in a
state bordering upon hysteria. The mystery
which surrounded him was the main cause.
He was never himself before an unknown
<span class="tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span>
<a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>quantity. He had too much imagination.
He made all sorts of surmises as to the stranger
who was haunting Clemency. Starting
with two known quantities, he might have accomplished
something, but here he had only
one: Clemency herself. He had a good head
for algebra, but a man cannot work out a
problem easily with only one known quantity.
He began to wonder if the poor girl herself
were sleeping. He realized a sort of protective
tenderness for her, and indignation on her
behalf. It did not occur to him as being love.
Still the image of her wonderful mother dominated
him. But his mind dwelt upon the girl.
He thought of a piazza whose roof opened as
he knew upon Clemency&#39;s room. He wondered
if a man like that would stick at anything.
Then he recalled what Doctor Gordon
had said about Clemency&#39;s not being in any
bodily danger, and again he speculated. The
room began to grow pale with the late winter
dawn. Familiar objects began to gain clearness
of outline. There were two windows in
James&#39;s room. They gave upon the piazza.
Suddenly James made a leap from his bed.
He sprang to one of the windows. Flattened
against it was the face of the man. But the
face was so destitute of consciousness of him,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span>
<a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that James doubted if he saw rightly. The
wide eyes seemed to gaze upon him without
seeing him, the mouth smiled as if at something
within. The next moment James was
sure that the face was not there. He drew
on his trousers, thrust his feet into his shoes,
and was out of his room and the house, and
on the piazza. It was still snowing, but the
dawn was overcoming the storm. The whole
world was lit with dead white pallor like the
face of a corpse. James rushed the length of
the piazza. He looked at the walk leading to
it. He thought he could distinguish footprints.
He looked on the piazza, but the
wind, being on the other side of the house,
there was not enough snow there to make
footprints visible. The snow on the walk
was drifted. He looked at it closely, and
made sure of deep marks. He stood for a
moment undecided what to do. He disliked
to arouse Doctor Gordon. He was afraid of
awakening Mrs. Ewing, if he ventured into
the upper part of the house. Then he thought
of the man Aaron who slept in a room over
the stable. He reÃ«ntered the house, locked
the front door, went softly into the doctor&#39;s
study, and out of the door which was near
the stable. Then he made a hard snowball,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span>
<a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and threw it at Aaron&#39;s window. The window
opened directly, and Aaron&#39;s head appeared.
James could see, even in the dim
light, and presumably just awakened from
sleep, the rotary motion of his jaws. He was
probably not chewing anything, simply moving
his mouth from force of habit. "Hullo!"
said Aaron, "that you Doctor Gordon?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, it is I," replied James. "Put on
something as quick as you can, and come
down here. Something is wrong."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron&#39;s head disappeared. In an incredibly
short space of time the stable door was
unlocked and slid cautiously back, and
Aaron stood there, huddled into his clothes.
"What&#39;s up?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know. Have you got a lantern
in the stable?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yep."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Light it quick, then, and come along with
me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron obeyed. "Anybody sick," he asked,
coming alongside with the flashing lantern.
He threw a cloth over it so as to prevent the
rays shining into the house windows. "I
don&#39;t want to frighten her," he said, and
James knew that he meant Mrs. Ewing.
"She&#39;s awful nervous," said Aaron. Then
he said again, "What&#39;s up?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span>
<a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I saw a man&#39;s face looking into one of my
windows," replied James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron gave a low whistle. "Somebody
wanted the doc?" he inquired.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No," replied James shortly, "it was not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Must have been."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, it was not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Must have been," repeated Aaron, chewing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I tell you it was not. I knew—" James
stopped. He suddenly wondered how much
he ought to tell the man, how much Doctor
Gordon had told him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron chewed imperturbably, but a sly look
came into his face. "I have eyes, and they
see, and ears, and they hear," he said, after
an odd Scriptural fashion, "but don&#39;t you
tell me nothin&#39;, Doctor Elliot. Either I take
what I get from the fountain-head, or I makes
my own conclusions that I can&#39;t help. Don&#39;t
you tell me nothin&#39;. S&#39;pose we look an&#39; see
ef there&#39;s footprints that show anythin&#39;."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron flashed the lantern, all the time carefully
shading it from the house windows, over
the walk which led to the front door and the
piazza. James followed him. "Well," said
Aaron, "there&#39;s been somebody here, but, with
snow like this, it might have been a monkey
<span class="tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span>
<a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or a rhinoceros or an alligator. You can&#39;t
make nothin&#39; of them tracks. But they do
go out to the road, and turn toward Stanbridge."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Suppose we—" began James. He was
about to suggest following the prints, when
he remembered Doctor Gordon&#39;s injunction
to the contrary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">However, Aaron anticipated him. "Might
as well leave the devil alone," said he. "It
might have been the old one himself, for all
we can tell by them tracks. You had better
go back to bed, Doctor Elliot. You ain&#39;t got
much on. It ain&#39;t near breakfast time yet.
Better go back to bed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And James thought such a course the wiser
one himself. He went back to bed, but not
to sleep. He kept his eyes fixed upon the
windows. He was prepared at any instant,
should the man reappear, to spring out. He
felt almost murderous. "It has come to a
pretty pass," he thought, "if that scoundrel,
whoever he may be, is lurking around the
house at night."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The daylight came slowly on account of the
storm. When it did come, it was an opaque
white daylight. James began to smell coffee
and frying ham. He rose and dressed himself,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span>
<a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and looked out of the window. It was
like looking into a blurred mirror. He began
to wonder if he could have been mistaken,
if possibly that face had been simply
a vision which had come from his overwrought
brain. He wondered if he should
tell Doctor Gordon, if it might not disturb
him unnecessarily. He wondered if he should
have enforced secrecy upon Aaron. He was
still undecided when the Japanese gong
sounded, and he went out to breakfast.
Clemency was looking worn and ill. Somehow
the sight of her piteous little face decided
James. He thought how easily an
athletic man could climb up one of those
piazza posts, which was, moreover, encircled
by a strong old vine which might almost
serve as ladder. He made up his mind to
tell Doctor Gordon, and he did tell him when
they were out upon their rounds, tilting and
sliding along the drifted country roads in an
old sleigh. "I don&#39;t think I can be mistaken,"
he said when he had finished.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon looked at him intently.
"You are sure," he said. "You are a nervous
subject for a man, and you had not slept,
and you had this man very much on your
mind, and there must have been some snow
<span class="tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span>
<a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on the window which could produce an illusion.
Be very sure, because this is serious."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James thought again of Clemency&#39;s little
white face. "Yes," he said, "I am sure."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You have no doubt at all?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"None. The man had his face staring into
the room. He did not seem to see me, but
looked past me at the bed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He might easily have thought that room,
being on the ground floor and accessible to
night-calls, was mine," said Doctor Gordon,
as if to himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I thought how easily he could have
climbed up one of the piazza posts to her
room," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Doctor started. "Yes, that is so," he
said. "He might have had two motives.
That is so."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next call was at a patient&#39;s who had a
slight attack of grippe. Doctor Gordon left
James there, saying that he would make another
call and be back for him directly.
James noticed how he urged the horses out
of the drive at almost a run. He was back
soon, and James having made up his prescription,
went out and got into the sleigh.
Doctor Gordon looked at him gloomily. "He
is no longer where he has been staying," he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span>
<a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said, and his face settled into a stern melancholy.
That evening, although the storm continued,
he suggested a visit to Georgie K.&#39;s;
and at supper time he insisted upon Clemency&#39;s
occupying another room that night.
"The wind is on your side of the house," he
said, "and I am afraid you will take more
cold." Clemency stared and pouted, then
said, "All right, Uncle Tom!"</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER VI</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Even the apple-jack and euchre at Georgie
K.&#39;s were not sufficient to entirely establish
Doctor Gordon in his devil-may-care mood.
Georgie K. kept looking at him with solicitation,
which had something tender about it.
"Don&#39;t you feel well, Doc?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Never felt better in my life," returned
Gordon quickly. "To-night I am feeling
particularly good, because I really think I
have evolved an utterly new theory of death
and disease which ought to make me famous,
if I ever get a chance to write a book about
it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Georgie K. stared at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know that you will understand,
old man," said Gordon, "but here it is. It
is simple in one way. Nobody will deny that
we come of the earth; well, we are sick and
die of the earth. We grow old and weary
and drop into our graves, because of the
tremendous, though unconscious and involuntary,
wear upon nerves and muscles and
emotion which is required to keep us here at
<span class="tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span>
<a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all. Gravitation kills us all in the end, just
as surely as if we fell off a precipice. Gravitation
is the destroyer, and gravitation is
earth-force. The same monster which produces
us devours us. That&#39;s so. I hope I
shall get a chance to write that book. Clubs
are trumps; pass."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sure you are well, Doc?" inquired
Georgie K., again scowling anxiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Never felt better, didn&#39;t I just say so?
You are a regular old hen, Georgie K. You
cluck at a fellow like a setting hen at one
chicken."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Still Doctor Gordon&#39;s gloomy face, although
he tried to be jocular, did not relax.
Going home late that night, or rather early
next morning, he laid his hand heavily on
James&#39;s shoulder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Boy, I am about at the finish!" he
groaned out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now, see here, Doctor Gordon, can&#39;t I
be of some assistance if you were to tell me?"
asked James. He passed his hand under the
older man&#39;s arm, and helped him through a
snowdrift as if he had been his father. A
great compassion filled his heart.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Gordon only groaned out a great sigh.
"No," he said. "Secrecy is the one shield I
<span class="tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span>
<a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have. I don&#39;t say weapon, but shield. In
these latter days we try to content ourselves
with shields; and secrecy is the strongest
shield on earth. If I were going to commit
a crime, I should never even intimate the
slightest motive for it to any man living. I
should trust no man living to help me through
with it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt a vague horror steal over him.
He tried to speak lightly to cover it. "I
trust there is no question of crime?" he said,
laughing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not the slightest," replied Gordon. "I
have no intention to use a weapon, but my
shield I must stick to. Thank the Lord, you
were awake last night, and to-night Clemency
is in another room. By the way, I have
bought a dog."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A dog?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, a bull terrier, well trained, but he
has a voice like a whole pack of hounds.
Clemency likes dogs. I will venture that no
one comes near the house after this without
waking him up."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You will keep him tied though."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, unless I get driven too far," replied
Gordon grimly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Does Mrs. Ewing like dogs?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span>
<a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She is as fond of them as Clemency."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When, the next day, the dog arrived James
was assured of the fact that both Clemency
and Mrs. Ewing did like dogs. They seemed
more pleased than he had ever seen them,
and the dog responded readily to their advances.
He was a splendid specimen of his
breed, very large, without a spot on his white
coat, and with beautiful eyes. Doctor Gordon
had a staple fixed in the vestibule, and the dog
was leashed to it at night. "I can&#39;t have
my patients driven away," he said with a
laugh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That evening Doctor Gordon had a call,
and he took Aaron with him. That left
James alone with Clemency, as Mrs. Ewing
retired almost immediately after Doctor Gordon
left.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After the jingle of the sleigh-bells had
died away Clemency laid down her work
and looked at James. The new dog was
lying at her feet. "Uncle Tom bought this
dog on account of him," she said. As she
spoke, she gave an odd significant gesture
over her shoulder as if the man were there,
and a look of horror came over her face.
Immediately the dog growled, and sprang
up, raced to the door, and let forth a volley
<span class="tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span>
<a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of howls and barks. "He knows," said
Clemency. "Isn&#39;t it queer? That dog
knows there is something wrong just by the
way I spoke and looked."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James himself was not quite so sure. He
glanced at the closed shutters. Then he went
himself to the door to be sure that it was
bolted as usual, and through into the study.
Everything was fast, but the dog continued
to race wildly back and forth from door to
windows, barking wildly, with a slender crest
of hair erect on his glossy white back. Emma,
the maid, came in from the kitchen, and met
James and Clemency in the hall. She looked
white, and was trembling. "I know there
was somebody about the house," she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James hesitated. He thought of a possible
patient. Still there had been no ring at the
office door. He considered a moment. Then
he sent Clemency, the maid, and the dog
back into the parlor, and before he opened
the outer door of the office he locked the
other which communicated with the rest of
the house, and put the key in his pocket.
Then he threw open the outer door and called,
"Anybody there?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Utter silence answered him. He looked
into a black wall of night. It was not snowing,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span>
<a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but the clouds were low and thick, and
no stars were visible. He called again in a
shout, "Hullo there! Who is it?" and obtained
no response. Then he closed the door,
fastened it, and returned to the living-room.
"I guess you were right," he said to Clemency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I think so," said Clemency. She
spoke to Emma. "Jack acted so because of
something I said to Doctor Elliot," she added.
"He thought something was wrong. He is
very intelligent." The dog was again lying
at her feet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Emma shook her head obstinately.
She was the middle-aged daughter of a New
Jersey farmer, and had lived with the family
ever since they had resided in Alton. She had
a harsh face, although rather good-looking,
"I have been used to dogs all my life," said
she, "and I never knowed a dog to act like
that unless there was somebody about the
house."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I have done all I could," said
James. "I called out the office door, and
nobody answered. It could not have been a
patient."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There was somebody about the house,"
repeated Emma. "Well, I must go and mix
up the bread."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span>
<a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">When she was gone, Clemency looked palely
at James. "Oh," she said, "do you think it
could have been that man?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No," replied James firmly; "it must have
been your gesture. That is a very intelligent
dog, and dogs have imagination. He imagined
something wrong."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I hope it was that," said Clemency faintly.
"It seems to me I should die if I thought that
terrible man were hanging about the house.
It is bad enough never to be able to go out
of doors."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctor Gordon says I may take you out
driving some evening," said James consolingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency looked at him with a brightening
face. "Did he?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then to James&#39;s utter surprise Clemency
broke down, and began to cry. "Oh," she
wailed, "I don&#39;t know as I want to go. I
am afraid all the time. If we were out driving,
and he came up to the horse&#39;s head, what
could we do?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He would get a cut across the face that
he would remember," James returned fiercely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But he would see me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It would be dark."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span>
<a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He might have a lantern."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You can wear a thick veil."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency sobbed harder than ever. "Oh,
no," she wailed, "I don&#39;t want to go so, in
the dark, with a thick veil over my face,
thinking every minute he may come. Oh,
no, I don&#39;t want to go."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You poor little soul," said James, and
there was something in his voice which he
himself had never heard before. Clemency
glanced up at him quickly, and he saw as
plainly as if he had been looking in a glass
himself in her blue eyes. Instantly emotions
of which he had dreamed, but never experienced,
leaped up in his heart like flame. He
knew that he loved Clemency. What he had
felt for her mother had been passionless
worship, giving all, and asking nothing.
This was love which asked as well as gave.
"Clemency," he began, and his voice was
hoarse with emotion. She turned her head
away, the tears were still on her cheeks, but
they were very red, and her cheeks were
dimpling involuntarily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well?" she whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you care anything about—me?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency nodded, still keeping her face
averted.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span>
<a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That means—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency said nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That means you love me," James whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency nodded again. Then she turned
her head slowly, and gave him a narrow blue
glance, and smiled like a shy child.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I was afraid—" she began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Afraid of what, dear?" James put his
arm about the girl, and the ashe-blonde head
dropped on his shoulder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Afraid you—didn&#39;t."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Afraid I didn&#39;t care?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency nodded against his breast.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think I must have cared all the time,
only at first, when I saw your mother—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency raised her head immediately and
gave it an indignant toss. "There," said she.
"I knew it. Very well, if you would rather
be my stepfather, you can, only I think you
would be a pretty one, no older, to speak of,
than I am, and I know my mother wouldn&#39;t
have you anyway. The idea of your thinking
that my mother would get married again
anyway, and especially to you," Clemency
said witheringly. She sat up straight and
looked at James. "I wish your father were a
widower, then I would marry him the minute
<span class="tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span>
<a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he asked me," said she, "and see how you
would like it. I guess you would have a step-mother
who would make you walk chalk."
Clemency tossed her head again. Then she
gave a queer little whimsical glance at James,
and both of them burst out laughing, and she
was in his arms again, and he was kissing her.
"There, that is enough," said she presently.
"I once wore out a doll I had kissing her. She
was wax, and it was warm weather, and I
actually did wear that doll out. The color all
came off her cheeks, and she got soft."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are not a doll, darling," said James
fervently, and he would have kissed her
again, but she pushed him away. "No,"
said she, "I know the color won&#39;t come off
my cheeks, but I might get soft like that doll.
One can never tell. You must stop now. I
want to talk to you. It is all right about my
mother."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It was only because I never saw such a
woman in all my life before," said James.
"I never thought of marrying."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You would have had to take it out in
thinking," said Clemency, "but it is all right.
I think myself that my mother is the most
wonderful woman that ever lived. I think
the old Greek goddesses must have looked
<span class="tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span>
<a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>just like her. I don&#39;t wonder you felt so
about her. I don&#39;t know as I should have
thought much of you if you hadn&#39;t. Why,
everybody falls down and worships her. Of
course I know that I am nothing compared
to her. I should be angry if you really
thought so."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t think so in one way," James
said honestly. "I don&#39;t think you are as
beautiful as your mother, but I love you,
Clemency."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, that will do for me," said Clemency.
"No, you need not kiss me again. I
think myself I shall make you a better wife
than a stepdaughter. You need not think
for one minute that I would have minded
you as I do Uncle Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But you will have to when we are married,"
said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency blushed and quivered. "Well,
maybe I will," she whispered. "I suppose
I shall be just enough of a fool to stay in the
house, if you order me, the way I do when
Uncle Tom does."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You shall stay in the house for no man
alive when I have you in charge," said James.
"Clemency—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span>
<a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I will take you out now, if you say so.
I can protect you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know you can," Clemency said, "but
I guess we had better not. You see Uncle
Tom doesn&#39;t know yet, and he will be coming
home, and—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am going to tell him just as soon as
he does," declared James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I wonder if you had better not wait,"
Clemency said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Wait? Why?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing, only poor Uncle Tom is frightfully
worried about something now. He worries
about that dreadful man, and I am afraid
he worries about mother. I don&#39;t know exactly
what he worries about; but I don&#39;t want
him worried about anything else."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t see for the life of me why he
should worry about this," said James with a
piqued air. He was, in fact, considering quite
naÃ¯vely that he was not a bad match, taking
into consideration his prospects, and Clemency
evidently needed all the protection she
could get.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency understood directly what his tone
implied. "Oh, goodness," said she, "of
course, as far as you are concerned, Uncle
Tom will be pleased. Why shouldn&#39;t he?
<span class="tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span>
<a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and so will mother. Here you are young
and handsome, and well educated, and good,
what more could anybody want for a girl,
unless they were on the lookout for a ducal
coronet or something of that sort? It isn&#39;t
that, only there is something queer, there
must be something queer, about that man,
and I don&#39;t know how much this might complicate
it. I don&#39;t know but Uncle Tom might
have more occasion to worry."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t see why," said James mystified,
"but I&#39;ll wait a few days if you say so, only
I hate to have anything underhanded, you
know. How about your mother?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Please wait and tell her when you tell
Uncle Tom," pleaded Clemency. All the
time she was completely deceiving the young
man. What she was really afraid of was
that James himself might run into danger
from this mysterious persecutor of hers if
the fact of her betrothal became known. "I
shall not mind staying in the house at all
now," she added. An expression came over
her face which James did not understand,
which no man would have understood.
Clemency was wonderfully skilled at needle-work,
and she had plenty of material in the
house. She was reflecting innocently how
<span class="tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span>
<a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>she could begin at once upon some dainty
little frills for her trousseau. A delight,
purely feminine, filled her fair little face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All the same," said James, "I am going
to take you out before long. You must have
some fresh air."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t mind," said Clemency, then she
broke off suddenly. She ran to the farther
end of the room, sat down, and snatched a
book from the table and opened it in the
middle, "It is Uncle Tom," she remarked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James laughed, crossed the room swiftly,
kissed her, then went into the office to greet
Doctor Gordon. Doctor Gordon stood by the
office fire taking off his overcoat. He looked
gloomier than usual. "Who is in there?"
he asked, pointing to the living-room wall.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Your niece," answered James. He felt
himself color, but the other man did not notice
it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mrs. Ewing has gone to bed?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, went directly after you left."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon&#39;s face grew darker. He had
tossed his coat over a chair, and stood staring
absently at the table with its prismatic
lights.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know where he is," he said presently
in a whisper.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span>
<a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You mean?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes," said Doctor Gordon impatiently.
"You know whom I mean. I saw him go
in—well, no matter where."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suspect that he has been hanging about
here," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The dog barked and acted queer."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dogs always did hate him," said Doctor
Gordon, with a queer expression. Then he
gave himself a shake. Here he said: "Let&#39;s
have something hot and a smoke." He called
to Emma to bring some hot water and sugar
and lemons and glasses. Then he produced
a bottle from a cabinet in the office, and himself
brewed a sort of punch, the like of which
James had never tasted before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s my own recipe," said Doctor Gordon,
laughing. "Nobody knows what it is,
not even Georgie K. But—" he hesitated a
little, then he added laughing, "I have left
it in my will for Georgie K. I made my will
some little time ago."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt it incumbent upon himself to
say something about Doctor Gordon being
still a young man comparatively, and healthy.
To his sanguine young mind a will seemed
ominous.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span>
<a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I have not reached the allotted
span," Gordon replied, "but healthier men
than I have come to their end sooner than
they expected, and I wanted to make sure of
some things. I wanted especially to make
sure that Clemency—Mrs. Ewing has relatives
in the West, and—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt somewhat bewildered. He could
not quite see what Gordon meant, but he took
another sip of the golden, fragrant compound
before him, and again remarked upon
its excellence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That makes me think," said Gordon, evidently
glad himself to turn the conversation.
"A sip of this will do poor little Clemency
good. You say she is in the parlor."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon opened the door and called Clemency,
who came with a little reluctance. The
girl was afraid of her uncle&#39;s eyes. She
sidled into the office like a child who had done
something wrong. She took her little glass of
punch, and never looked at James or her uncle.
James, too, did not look at her. He smoked,
and almost turned his back upon her. Doctor
Gordon looked from one to the other, and his
face changed. Clemency slipped out as soon
as she could, saying that she was tired. Then
<span class="tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span>
<a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Gordon turned abruptly upon James. "There
is something between you two, Clemency and
you," he said in a brusque voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James colored and hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Out with it," said Gordon peremptorily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency wished—" began James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Wished you to keep it secret, of course.
Well, she told me herself, poor little soul, the
moment she came into the room."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James sat still. He did not know what to
do. Finally he said in a stammering voice
that he hoped there would be no objection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No objection certainly on my part or Mrs.
Ewing, if Clemency has taken a fancy to you,"
replied Doctor Gordon. "But—" he hesitated
a moment. "It is only fair to tell you
that you yourself may later on entertain
some very reasonable objection," Gordon said
grimly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is impossible," James cried eagerly.
"I have known her only a few weeks, but I
feel as if it were a lifetime. Nothing can
change me. And as for money, if you mean
anything of that kind, I don&#39;t care if she
hasn&#39;t a cent. I have my profession, and my
father is well-to-do. Then, besides, I have a
little that an aunt, my mother&#39;s sister, left
me. I can support Clemency."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span>
<a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is not that," Gordon said. "Clemency
has—at least I think I can secure it to her—a
little fortune of her own, and she will have
something besides. I was not thinking of
money at all."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then there can be nothing," James said
positively. His sense of embarrassment had
passed. He beamed at the older man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There can be something else. There is
something else," Gordon said gloomily. "I
don&#39;t know but I ought to tell you, but, the
truth is, you know my theory with regard to
secrecy. I don&#39;t doubt but you can hold your
tongue, yet the whole affair is so dangerous,
that I dare not, I cannot, tell you yet. I can
only say this, that there does exist some obstacle
to your marriage with my niece, and
your engagement must be regarded by myself
in a tentative light. If the time ever comes
when you know all, and wish to withdraw,
you can do so in my opinion with perfect
honor. In the meantime you had better say
nothing to any one outside. You had better
not even tell Mrs. Ewing. I hope Clemency
herself will not. Perhaps when she has had
a few hours in which to collect herself, her
face will not be quite so tell-tale."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing whatever can change me," said
James, with almost anger.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span>
<a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon shook his head. "I begin to think
I may have done you a wrong having you
come here at all," he said. "I suppose I
ought to have thought of the possibility, but
I have had so much on my mind."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You have done me the greatest good I
ever had done me in my whole life," James
said fervently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon rose and shook the young man&#39;s
hand. "As far as Clemency and I and Mrs.
Ewing are concerned," he said, "nothing
could have been better. Well, we will hope for
the best, my boy." He clapped James on the
shoulder and smiled, and James went to his
room feeling dizzy with happiness and mystery,
and a trifle so with the doctor&#39;s punch.</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER VII</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next morning James was awakened by
loud voices coming from the vicinity of the
stable. He had not slept very well, and now
at dawn felt drowsy, but the voices would not
let him sleep. He rose, dressed, and went out
in the stable-yard. There he found Doctor
Gordon, Aaron, and a strange man, small, and
red-haired, and thin-faced, with shifty eyes,
holding by the bridle a fine black horse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t want to buy a horse with a bridle
on," Doctor Gordon was saying as James appeared.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you think I&#39;m the man to bear insults?"
inquired the little red-haired man
with fierceness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Insult nothing. It is business," said Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s so," Aaron said, chewing and eyeing
the black horse and the red-haired man
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well," said the little red-haired man with
an air at once of injured innocence and ferocity,
"if you want to know why I object to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span>
<a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>selling this horse without a bridle, come here,
and I&#39;ll show you." Gordon and Aaron and
James approached. The red-haired man
slipped the bridle, and underneath it appeared
a small sore. "There, that&#39;s the reason, and
I&#39;ll tell you the truth," said the man defiantly.
"Here I am trying to sell this darned critter;
paid a cool hundred for him, and everybody
says jest as you do, won&#39;t buy him with the
bridle on. Then I takes off the bridle, and
they sees this little bile, and there&#39;s an end to
it. I suppose it&#39;s the same with you. Well,
good day, gentlemen. You&#39;re losin&#39; a darned
good trade, but it ain&#39;t my fault. Here&#39;s an
animal I paid a cool hundred for, and I&#39;m
offering him for ninety. I&#39;m ten dollars out,
besides my time."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Let me see that sore again," said Gordon.
He slipped the bridle and examined the
place carefully. Then he looked hard at the
horse, which stood with great docility, although
he held his head proudly. He was a
fine beast, glossy black in color, and had a
magnificent tail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Make it eighty-five," said Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Couldn&#39;t think of it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know as I want the horse anyway,"
said Gordon.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span>
<a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ll call it eighty-seven and a half," said
the little red-haired man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon stood still for a moment. Then he
pulled out his wallet. "Eighty-six and call
it square," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All right," said the red-haired man.
"It&#39;s a-givin&#39; of him away, but I&#39;m so
darned tired of trampin&#39; the country with
him, that I&#39;ll call it eighty-six, and it&#39;s the
biggest bargain you ever got in your life in
the way of horse flesh. I wouldn&#39;t let him
go at that figure, but my wife&#39;s sick, and I
want to get home."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The red-haired man carefully counted over
the roll of bank-notes which Doctor Gordon
gave him, although it seemed to James that
he used some haste. He also thought that he
was evidently anxious to be gone. He refused
Gordon&#39;s offer of breakfast, saying
that he had already had some at the hotel.
Then he was gone, walking with uncommon
speed for such a small man. Aaron, James,
and Doctor Gordon stood contemplating the
new purchase. James patted him. "He
looks like a fine animal," he remarked.
Aaron shifted his quid, and said with emphasis,
"Want me to hitch up and bring that
little red-haired cuss back?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span>
<a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, what for?" asked Doctor Gordon.
"I guess I have made a good trade, Aaron."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You mark my words, there&#39;s somethin&#39;
out," said Aaron dogmatically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I guess you&#39;re wrong this time," said
Doctor Gordon, laughing. "Come, Elliot, it
is time for breakfast, and we have to drive
to Wardville afterward for that fever case."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James followed Gordon into the dining-room.
Clemency said good morning almost
rudely, then she hid her face behind the coffee-urn.
Gordon glanced at her and smiled
tenderly, but the girl did not see it. James
never looked her way at all. She turned the
coffee with apparent concentration. She did
not dare look at either of the two men. She
had never felt so disturbedly happy and so
shy. She had not slept all night, she was so
agitated with happiness, but this morning
she showed no traces of sleeplessness. There
was an unwonted color on her little fair face,
and her blue eyes were like jewels under her
drooping lids.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They were nearly through breakfast when
the door which led into the kitchen was abruptly
thrown open, and Aaron stood there.
In his hand he flourished dramatically a great
streaming mass of black. "Told you so," he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span>
<a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>observed with a certain triumph. The others
stared at him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What on earth is that?" asked Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That new horse&#39;s tail; it comes off," replied
Aaron with brevity. Then he chewed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Comes off?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron nodded, still chewing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon rose from the table saying something
under his breath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That ain&#39;t all," said Aaron, still with an
air of sly triumph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What else, for Heaven&#39;s sake?" cried
Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, he cribs," replied Aaron laconically.
Then he chewed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That was why he didn&#39;t want to take the
bridle off?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon stood staring for a second, then he
burst into a peal of laughter. "Bless me if
I ever got so regularly done," said he. "Say,
Aaron, that was a smart chap. He has talent,
he has."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Aren&#39;t you going to try to find him?"
asked James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, we&#39;ll keep a lookout on the way to
Wardville," said Gordon; "and, Aaron, you
may as well put the chestnut in the old buggy
<span class="tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span>
<a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and drive Stanbridge way, and see if you
can get sight of him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He&#39;s had a half-hour&#39;s start," said Aaron.
"You might track a fox, but you can&#39;t him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I guess you are about right," said Gordon,
"but we&#39;ll do all we can. However, I
think I&#39;ll try to get even with Sam Tucker.
It&#39;s a good chance. I&#39;ll drive the new horse
to Wardville. Aaron, you just tie that tail
on again, and fasten it up so as to keep it out
of the mud."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron grinned. "Goin&#39; to get even for
that white horse?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m going to try it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon was all interest. James regarded
him as he had done so many times before with
wonder. That such a man should have such
powers of assimilation astounded him. He
was actually as amused and interested in
being done, as he called it, and in trying in his
turn to wipe off some old score, as any countryman.
He seemed, to the young man, to
have little burrows like some desperate animal,
into which he could dive, and be completely
away from his enemies, and even from
himself, when he chose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He hurriedly drank the remainder of his
coffee, and was in his office getting his medicine-case
<span class="tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span>
<a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ready. James lingered, in the hopes
of getting a word and a kiss from Clemency.
But the child, the moment her uncle went
out, fled. It was odd. She wanted to stay
and have a minute with James alone more
than she had ever wanted anything, but it
was for just that very reason that she ran
away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt hurt. At that time, the mind
of a girl, and its shy workings, were entirely
beyond his comprehension. He saw no
earthly reason why Clemency should have
avoided him. He followed Gordon with
rather a downcast face into the office, and
begun assisting him with his medicines.
Gordon himself was too full of interest in
the horse trade to remark anything. At
times he chuckled to himself. Now and then
he would burst out anew in a great peal of
laughter. "Hang it all! I don&#39;t like to be
done any better than any other man, but that
little red-haired scamp was clever and no
mistake," he said, "showing me that little
sore. I believe he had sandpapered the poor
beast on purpose. He took me in as neatly
as I ever saw anything done in my life.
Well, Elliot, you wait and see me get even
with Sam Tucker. I have been waiting my
<span class="tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span>
<a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chance. About two years ago he worked me,
and not half as cleverly as this either. He
made me feel that I was a fool. The red-haired
one needed the devil himself to get
round him, and see through his little game.
Sam Tucker sold me, or rather traded with
me a veritable fiend of a horse for an old
mare. The mare was old, but she had a lot
of go in her, and was sound, and the other,
well, Sam had bought him for a song, because
nobody would drive him, and he had killed
two men. He was a white horse with as
wicked an eye as you ever saw, and ears always
cocked for mischief, like the arch fiend&#39;s
horns. Well, Sam, he made some kind of a
dye, and he actually dyed that animal a beautiful
chestnut, and traded him for my old mare.
I even paid a little to boot. Well, next morning
I sent Aaron down to the store in a soaking
rain, and the horse bolted at a white rock
beside the road, and the buggy was knocked
into kindling wood. Aaron wasn&#39;t hurt.
He always comes out right side up. But
when he came leading that snorting, dancing
beast home, the chestnut dye was pretty well
off, and I knew him in a minute. Well, he
was shot, and I was my old mare and some
money out. I wasn&#39;t going to have men&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span>
<a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lives on my conscience. But this is another
matter. Now I&#39;ve got my chance to get even,
and I&#39;m going to get my old mare back."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Presently the two men were out on the road
driving the black horse. He went well enough,
and seemed afraid of nothing. "There&#39;s not
much the matter with this animal except the
tail and the cribbing, I guess," said the doctor.
"As for the tail, that is simply a question
of ornament and taste. The cribbing is
more serious, of course, but I guess Sam
Tucker won&#39;t be in any danger of his life."
They had not gone far before the doctor drew
up before a farmhouse on the left. A man
with a serious face, thin and wiry, was coming
around the house with a wheelbarrowful
of potatoes. "Hullo, Sam!" called Doctor
Gordon. The man left his barrow and came
alongside. James could see that he had a
keen eye upon the horse. "Fine morning,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sam Tucker gave a grunt by way of assent.
He was niggardly with speech.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Have you got any more of those Baldwin
apples to sell?" asked Doctor Gordon, to
James&#39;s intense surprise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sam Tucker looked reflectively at the doctor
for a full minute, then gave utterance to
a monosyllable. "Bar&#39;l."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span>
<a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So you&#39;ve got a barrel to sell," said
Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sam nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I&#39;ll send my man over for them.
They are mighty fine apples, and Emma said
yesterday that we were about out. I suppose
they are the same price."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sam nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Seems as if you might take off a little,
it is so late, and you might have them spoiling
on your hands," said Gordon, and James
began to wonder if they had come to drive a
sharp bargain on apples instead of horses.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sam shook his head emphatically. "Same,"
he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I suppose I&#39;ve got to pay it if you
ask it," said Gordon. "I can&#39;t buy any such
apples elsewhere. You&#39;ve got it your way.
I&#39;ll send the money over by Aaron." Doctor
Gordon gathered up the reins, but Sam Tucker
seemed to experience a sudden convulsion all
over his lank body. "Horse," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon drove on a yard, but Sam,
running alongside, he stopped. "Yes," he
said placidly, "horse. What do you think of
him?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sam said nothing. He looked at the horse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He&#39;s the biggest bargain I ever got," said
<span class="tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span>
<a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Gordon. "I am going to hang on to him.
Once in a while there is an honest deal in
horses. I am not bringing up anything, Sam.
I believe in letting bygones be bygones, although
you did risk my life and my man&#39;s.
But this time I am all right." Gordon
gathered up the reins again, and again
Sam Tucker stopped him. James barely
saw the man&#39;s mouth move. He could not
hear that he said anything, but a peculiar
glow of eager greed lit up his long face, and
Gordon seemed to understand him perfectly.
"You can take your oath not," he said
brusquely. "What do you take me for?
You have stuck me once, and now you think
you are going to do it again. You can bet
your life you are not." Again he gathered
up the reins. Sam Tucker&#39;s face gleamed like
a coal. James saw for the first time in its
entirety the trading instinct rampant. Again
Gordon seemed to understand what had apparently
not been spoken. "No, Sam
Tucker," he declared almost brutally, "I
will not trade back for that old mare you
cheated me out of, not if you were to give
me your whole farm to boot. I know that
old mare. I wasn&#39;t the only one that got
stuck. She&#39;s got the heaves. I know her.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span>
<a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>No, sir, you don&#39;t do me again. I&#39;ve got a
good horse this time, and I mean to hang on
to him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again Gordon attempted to drive on, and
once more Sam stopped him. James felt at
last fairly dizzy, when he heard the farmer
almost beg Gordon to trade horses, offer him
twenty-five dollars to boot, and the apples.
He sat in the buggy watching while the mare
was led out of the stable, the black horse was
taken out of the traces, and the bridle was
left on without a remonstrance on Sam&#39;s
part, and exchanged for a much newer one,
while twenty-five dollars in dirty bank-notes
were carefully counted out by Sam, and then
Gordon jumped into the buggy and drove
off. He was quivering with suppressed
mirth. "The biter is bitten this time," he
said as soon as he was out of hearing of Sam
Tucker. Then he made an exclamation of
dismay.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What&#39;s the matter?" asked James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I have left my whip. I must risk
it and go back. I paid a lot for that whip."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon turned and drove back at a sharp
trot. When they came alongside the farm
fence James saw the whip lying on the
ground, and jumped out to get it. He was
<span class="tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span>
<a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>back in the buggy, and they were just proceeding
on their way, when there was a shout,
and Sam Tucker came rushing around the
house, and held the horse&#39;s tail as Aaron
had done in the morning. "Comes off," he
gasped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course," said the doctor coolly. "I
didn&#39;t say it didn&#39;t. It&#39;s for convenience in
muddy weather."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Cribs," gasped Sam Tucker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, a little," said Gordon. "Keep him
away from hitching-posts. You didn&#39;t say
you wanted a horse to hitch. He never cribs
when he&#39;s driven. Good-day, Sam."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon and James were off again. Gordon
was doubled up with merriment, in which
James joined. "I&#39;m glad to get behind old
Fanny once more," said Gordon. "She&#39;s
worth two of that other animal! Clemency
will be glad to see her again. She felt badly
when I traded her. In fact, I wouldn&#39;t have
done it if I had known how much the child
cared for the mare. She used to drive her a
lot and pet her. I think it will be perfectly
safe for you to take Clemency out driving
when there isn&#39;t a moon. Fanny is pretty
fast when she is touched with the whip, and,
though she&#39;s gentle, she hasn&#39;t much use for
<span class="tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span>
<a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>strangers. I don&#39;t think she would stand a
stranger at her head. I think you may go
out to-night, if you like. Poor Clemency
needs the air. We&#39;ll use the team this afternoon,
and Fanny will be fresh by evening."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James colored. He remembered how Clemency
had avoided him that morning. "Perchance
she won&#39;t care to go," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course, she will," said Gordon. "She
will go, and I want her to, but you must always
bear in mind what I told you last night,
and—" he hesitated. "Don&#39;t do your utmost
to make the poor little thing think you
are the moon and sun and stars in case you
should change your mind," he finished.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I shall never change my mind," James
said hotly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You will be justified if you do," Gordon
said gravely. "Perhaps you will not. But
you are old enough, and ought to have self-command
enough to keep your head, and
shield the poor child against possible contingencies.
You have not known each other very
long. It is not possible that she would die
of it now, nor you. If you can only keep
your head, and meander along the path of
love instead of plunging into bottomless
depths, it will be better for both of you. I
<span class="tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span>
<a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>know what I am talking about. I am old
enough to be your father. Go slow, for
God&#39;s sake, if you care about the girl."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She is the whole world to me," said
James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then, go slow! It will be better for her
if you are not the whole world to her, until
you know what a day may bring forth."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t care what a day brings forth."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are tempting the gods?" said Gordon.
"Elliot, you don&#39;t know what you are
talking about. I am not treating you fairly
not to tell you the whole story, but I don&#39;t
see my way clear. You must bear in mind
what I say. I did not think of any such
complication when you came here. I was a
fool not to. I know what young people are,
and Clemency is a darling, and you have
your good points. The amount of it is, if I
don&#39;t get stuck by Sam Tucker in a horse
trade, Fate sticks me in something bigger. I
don&#39;t see the inevitable, I suppose, because
I am so close to it that it is like facing the
wall of a precipice all the time. We have to
stop here. The woman&#39;s daughter is coming
down with a fever, which will not kill her,
and she will have it to brag of all her life.
She will date all earthly events from this
fever. Whoa, Fanny!"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span>
<a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">That evening James and Clemency went
for a drive. It was a clear night, but dark,
save for the stars. Clemency had a thick veil
over her face, which seemed entirely unnecessary.
Directly as they started, she made a
little involuntary nestling motion toward the
young man at her side. It was as innocent
as the nestling of a baby. James put his arm
around her. He thought with indignation of
Doctor Gordon&#39;s warning, as if anything in
the world could cause him to change his mind
about this dear child who loved him. "You
darling!" he whispered. "So you have not
thought better of it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you mean?" Clemency whispered
back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, dear, you have fairly run away
from me all day long."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I was afraid," Clemency whispered, then
she put her head against his shoulder, and
laughed a delicious little laugh. "I never
was in love before, and I don&#39;t know how to
act," said she.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Put up your veil," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I want a kiss."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency put up her veil obediently and
kissed him like a child. Then there was a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span>
<a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sudden flash of light from a lantern, and a
dark form was at the mare&#39;s head. But she
was true to her master&#39;s opinion of her. She
gave a savage duck at the man and started
violently, so that James was forced to release
Clemency and devote his entire attention
to driving. Clemency shrank close to
him, shivering like one in a chill. "He saw
me," she gasped. "It was that same man, and
this time he saw me."</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER VIII</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">James and Clemency had hardly started
upon their drive before there was a ring at
the office door, and Doctor Gordon, who was
alone there, answered it. He was confronted
by a man who lived half-way between Alton
and the next village on the north. He had
walked some three miles to get some medicine
for his wife, who was suffering from
rheumatism. He was pathetically insistent
upon the fact that his wife did not require a
call from the doctor, only some medicine.
"Now, see here, Joe," said Gordon, "if I
really thought your wife needed a call, I
would go, and it should not cost you a cent
more than the medicine, but I am dog tired,
and not feeling any too well myself, and if
her symptoms are just as you say, I think I
can send her something which will fix her up
all right."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She is just the way she was last year,"
said the man. He did not look unlike Gordon,
although he was poorly clad, and was a
genuine son of the New Jersey soil. His
poor clothes, even his skin, had a clayey hue,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span>
<a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as if he had been really cast from the mother
earth. It was frozen outside, but a reddish
crust from the last thaw was on his hulking
boots. He spoke with a drawl, which was
nasal, and yet had something sweet in it.
"I would have came this afternoon, but I
was afraid you might have went out," he remarked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I was out," replied Gordon, who was
filling out a prescription. The man stooped
and patted the bull terrier, which had not
evinced the slightest emotion at his entrance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mighty fine dog," said the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, he is a pretty good sort," replied Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Shouldn&#39;t like to meet him if I had came
up to your house an&#39; no one round, and he
had took a dislike to me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I should not myself," said Gordon. "But
he does not dislike you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dogs know me pooty well," said the man.
"They ain&#39;t no particler likin&#39; for me. Don&#39;t
want to run and jump an&#39; wag, but they
know I mean well, and they mostly let me
alone."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I guess that&#39;s so," said Gordon.
"Jack would have barked if he had not
known you were all right, Joe."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span>
<a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Queer how much they know," said the
man reflectively, and a dazed look overspread
his dingy face with its cloud of beard. If
once he became launched upon a current of
reflection, he lost his mental bearings instantly
and drifted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, they do know," said Gordon.
"Now listen, Joe! You see this bottle. You
give your wife a spoonful of the medicine in a
glass of water every three hours. Mind, you
make it a whole tumbler full of water."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course, you need not wake her up if
she gets to sleep," said the doctor, "but every
three hours when she is awake."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, sir." The man began fumbling in
his pocket, but Gordon stopped him. "No,"
he said, "put up your pocketbook, Joe. I
don&#39;t want any money. I get this medicine
at wholesale, and it don&#39;t cost much."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I come prepared to pay," said the man.
He straightened his shoulders and flushed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, well," said Doctor Gordon, "wait.
If you need more medicine, or it seems necessary
that I should drive over to see your wife,
you can do a little work on my garden in the
spring, or you can let me have a bushel of
your new potatoes when they are grown next
<span class="tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span>
<a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>summer, or some apples, and we&#39;ll call it
square. Wait; I don&#39;t want any money for
that bottle of medicine to-night anyhow. Did
you walk over, Joe?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Joe said that he had walked over. "Aaron
might just as well drive you home as not,"
said Gordon. "The sooner your wife has
that medicine the better. How is the baby
getting along?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"First-rate. I&#39;d just as soon walk, doctor."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For answer Gordon opened the door and
called Aaron, and told him to hitch up and
take the man home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctor Elliot has gone with the bay,"
said Aaron. "The teams are about played
out, and there&#39;s nothin&#39; except the gray."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Take her then."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She looked when I fed her jest now as if
she was half a mind to balk at takin&#39; her
feed," Aaron remarked doubtfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nonsense! Give her a loose rein, and
she&#39;ll be all right."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Aaron went out grumbling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon offered the man a cigar, which he
accepted as if it had been a diamond. "I&#39;ll
save it up for next Sunday, when I&#39;ve got a
little time to sense it," he said. "I know
what your cigars be."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span>
<a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon forced another upon him, and the
man looked as pleased as a child.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Presently a shout was heard, and Gordon
opened the office door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Here&#39;s Aaron with the buggy," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He stood in the doorway watching, but the
gray, instead of balking, went out of the
yard with an angry plunge. Gordon shook
his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Confound him, he&#39;s pulling too hard on
the lines," he muttered. Then he closed and
locked the office door, and went into the living-room
to find it deserted. Gordon called
up the stairs. "Have you gone to bed,
Clara?" His voice was at once tenderly
solicitous and angry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Ewing answered him from above, and
in her tone was something propitiating. "Yes,
Tom, dear," she called.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon hesitated a moment. His face took
on its expression of utmost misery. "Is—the
pain very bad?" he called then, and
called as if he were in actual fear.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, dear," the woman&#39;s patient, beseeching
voice answered, "not very bad."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not very?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, only I felt a little twinge, and thought
I had better go to bed. I am quite comfortable
<span class="tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span>
<a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>now. I think I shall go to sleep. I am
sorry to leave you alone all the evening, Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s right," called Gordon. His voice
rang harsh, in spite of his effort to control
it. He threw his arm over his eyes, and fairly
groped his way back to his office, stifling his
sobs. When he was in his office he flung
himself into a chair, and bent his head over
his hands on the table, and his whole frame
shook. "Oh, my God!" he muttered. "Oh,
my God!" He did not weep, but he gasped
like a child whom his mother has commanded
not to weep. Terrible emotion fairly convulsed
him. He struggled with it as with a
visible foe. At last he sat up and filled his
pipe. The dog had crept close to him, and
was nestling against him and whimpering.
Gordon patted his head. The dog licked his
hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The simple, ignorant sympathy of this poor
speechless thing nearly unnerved the man
again, but he continued to smoke. He looked
at the dog, whose honest brown eyes were
fixed upon him with an almost uncanny
understanding, and reflected how the woman
upstairs, who was passing out of his life, had
become in a few days so associated with the
animal, that after she was gone he could
<span class="tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span>
<a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>never see him without a pang. He looked
about the office, with whose belongings she
was less associated than with anything in the
house, and it seemed to him that everything
even there would have for him, after she had
passed, a terrible sting of reminiscence. It
seemed to him, as he looked about, as if she
were already gone. He was, in fact, suffering
as keenly in anticipation as he would in reality.
The horror, the worst horror of life, of
being left alive with the dead and the associations
of the dead was already upon him.
Some people are comforted by such associations,
others they rend. Gordon was one
whom they would rend, whom they did rend.
He made up his mind, as he sat there, that
he would have to go away from Alton, and
enter new scenes for the healing of his spirit,
and yet he knew that he should not go: that
at the last his courage would assert itself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He sat smoking, the dog&#39;s head on his
knee. There was not a sound to be heard in
the house. Emma, the maid, had gone away
to visit a sick sister. She might not be back
that night. So there was absolute silence,
even in the kitchen. Suddenly the dog lifted
his head and listened to something which
Gordon could not himself hear. He watched
<span class="tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span>
<a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the dog curiously. The dog gave a low growl
of fear and rage, and made for the office door.
He began scratching at the threshold, and
emitted a perfect volley of barks. It did not
sound like one dog, but a whole pack. Gordon,
with an impulse which he could not
understand, quickly put out the prism-fringed
lamp which hung over his table. Then he
sprang to the dog, and had the dog by the
collar. "Be still, Jack," he said in a low
voice, and the dog obeyed instantly, although
he was quivering under his hand. Gordon
could feel the muscles run like angry serpents
under the smooth white hair, he felt
the crest of rage along his back. But the
animal was so well trained that he barked
no more. He only growled very softly, as
if to himself, and quivered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon ordered him to charge in a whisper,
and the dog stretched himself at his
feet, although it was like the crouch of a live
wire. Then Gordon rose and went softly to
a window beside the door. The office had
very heavy red curtains. It was impossible,
since they were closely drawn, that a ray of
light from within should have been visible
outside. Gordon had reasoned it out quickly
when he extinguished the lamp. Whoever
<span class="tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span>
<a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was without would have had no possible
means of knowing that anything except the
dog was in the office, but the light once out,
Gordon could peep around the curtain and
ascertain, without being himself seen, what
or who was about. He had a premonition
of what he should see, and he saw it. The
stable door was almost directly opposite that
of the office. Between the two doors there
was a driveway. On this driveway the only
pale thing to be seen in the darkness was the
tall, black figure of a man standing perfectly
still, as if watching. His attitude was unmistakable.
The long lines of him, upreared
from the pale streak of the driveway, were
as plainly to be read as a sign-post. They
signified watchfulness. His back was toward
the office. He stood face toward the curve
of the drive toward the road, where any one
entering would first be seen. Gordon, peeping
around his curtain, knew the dark figure
as he would have known his own shadow.
In one sense it had been for years his shadow,
and that added to the horror of it. The man
behind the curtain watched, the man in the
drive watched; and the dog, crouched at the
threshold of the door, watched with what
sublimated sense God alone knew, which enabled
<span class="tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span>
<a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him to know as much as his master,
and now and then came the low growl. Gordon
began to formulate a theory in his mind.
He remembered suddenly the man whom
Aaron had driven home. He realized that
the watching man might easily have mistaken
him for Gordon himself, going away
with his man to make a call upon some patient.
He suspected, with an intensity which
became a certainty, that the man knew that
Clemency and Elliot were out and would
presently return, and that it was for them he
was watching. All the time he thought of the
sick woman upstairs, and was glad that her
room faced on the other side of the house.
He was in agony lest she should be disturbed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon was usually a man of resources,
but now he did not know what to do.
The dark figure on the park-drive made now
and then a precautionary motion of his right
arm as he watched, which was significant.
Gordon knew that he was holding a revolver
in readiness. In the event of Aaron returning
alone he would probably be puzzled, and
Gordon thought that he might slip away. In
the event of James and Clemency returning
first, Gordon thought that he knew conclusively
what he purposed—a bullet for James,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span>
<a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and then away with the girl, unless he was
hindered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon let the curtain slip back into place,
and with a warning gesture to the dog, who
was ready for action, he tiptoed across the
room to the table, in a drawer of which he
kept his own revolver. He opened the drawer
softly, and rummaged with careful hands.
No revolver was there. He made sure. He
even opened other drawers and rummaged,
but the weapon was certainly missing. He
stood undecided for a moment. Then he went
softly out of the room, bidding in a whisper
the dog to follow. He crept upstairs and
paused at a closed chamber door. Then he
opened it very carefully. Mrs. Ewing at
once spoke. "Is that you, dear?" she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I wanted to tell you not to be frightened,
dear, if you should hear a shot or the
dog bark."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was a rustling in the dark room.
Mrs. Ewing was evidently sitting up in bed.
"Oh, Tom, what is it?" she whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon forced a laugh. "Nothing at all,"
he replied, "except there&#39;s a fox or something
out in the yard, and Jack is wild. I
may get a shot at him. Do you know where
my revolver is?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span>
<a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, where you always keep it, dear, in
the table drawer in the office."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t seem to see it. I guess I will take
your little pistol."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Tom, I am sorry, but I know that
won&#39;t go off. Clemency tried it the other day.
You remember that time Emma dropped it.
I think something or other got bent. You
know it was a delicate little thing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, well," said Gordon carelessly, "I
dare say I can find my revolver."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t see who could have taken it away."
said Mrs. Ewing. "I am sorry about my pistol,
because you gave it to me too, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ll get another for you," said Gordon,
"Those little dainty, lady-like, pearl-mounted
weapons don&#39;t stand much."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am feeling very comfortable, dear,"
Mrs. Ewing said in her anxious, sweet voice.
"You will be careful, won&#39;t you, with your
revolver, with that dog jumping about?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, dear. I dare say I shall not use the
revolver anyway, but don&#39;t be frightened if
you should hear a little commotion."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Go to sleep."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I think I can. I do feel rather
sleepy."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span>
<a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon closed the door carefully and retraced
his steps to the office, the dog at his
heels. He slipped the curtain again and
looked out. The man still stood watching in
the driveway. Gordon had never been at
such a loss as to his best course of action.
He was absolutely courageous, but here he
was unarmed, and he could have no reasonable
doubt that if he should go out, he would
be immediately shot. In such a case, what
of the woman upstairs? And, moreover,
what of James and Clemency? He thought
of any available weapon, but there was nothing
except his own stick. That was stout, it
was true, but could he be quick enough with
it? His mad impulse to rush out unarmed
except with that paltry thing could hardly
be restrained, but he had to think of other
lives beside his own.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He began to think that the only solution of
the matter was the return of Aaron alone.
The watching man would immediately realize
that he had made some mistake, that he, Gordon,
was in the house, or had been left at the
home of a patient. He could have no possible
reason for molesting the man. He
would probably slip aside into a shadow,
then make his way back to the road. In
<span class="tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span>
<a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>such a case Gordon determined that he and
Aaron would follow him to make sure that
no harm came to James and Clemency. So
Gordon stood motionless waiting, in absolute
silence, except for the frequently recurring
mutter of fear and rage of the dog.
As time went on he became more and more
uneasy. It seemed to him finally that Aaron
should have been back long before. He
moved stealthily across the room, and consulted
his watch by the low light of the
hearth fire. Aaron had been gone an hour.
He should have returned, for the mare was
a good roadster when she did not balk. Gordon
shook his head. He began to be almost
sure that the mare had balked. He returned
to the window. His every nerve was on the
alert. The moment that James and Clemency
should drive into the yard, he made
ready to spring, but the horrible fear lest it
should be entirely unavailing haunted him.
If only Aaron would come. Then the man
would slip into cover of the shadows, and
steal out into the road, and Gordon would
jump into the buggy, and he and Aaron would
follow him. He knew the man well enough
to be sure that he would never venture an
attack upon James and Clemency with witnesses.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span>
<a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>If only Aaron would come! Gordon
became surer that the mare had balked. He
vowed within himself that she should be shot
the next day if she had. Every moment he
thought he heard the sound of wheels and
horse&#39;s hoofs. His nervous tension became
something terrible. Once he thought of stealing
through the house, and out by the front
door, and walking to meet James and Clemency
so as to warn them. But that would
leave the helpless woman upstairs alone. He
dared not do that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He thought then of going to the front of
the house, and watching there, and endeavoring
to intercept James and Clemency before
they turned into the driveway. But
he felt that he could not for one second relax
his watch upon the watching man, and
he had no guarantee whatever that, at the
first sound of wheels, the man himself would
not make for the front of the house. Then
he thought, as always, of not disturbing the
sick woman whose room faced the road. It
seemed to him that his only course was to
remain where he was and wait for the return
of Aaron before James and Clemency.
He knew now that the horse must have balked.
His only hope was that James and Clemency,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span>
<a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>since it was such a fine night, and time
is so short for lovers, might take such a long
drive that even the balky mare might relent.
Always he heard at intervals the trot of a
horse, which only existed in his imagination.
He began to wonder if he should know when
Aaron, or Clemency and James, actually did
drive into the yard, if he should be quick
enough. Suddenly he thought of the dog:
that he would follow him, and of what might
happen. The dog&#39;s chain-leash was on the
table. He stole across, got it, fastened it to
the animal&#39;s collar, and made the end secure
to a staple which he had had fixed in
the wall for that purpose. As yet no intention
of injury to the man except in self-defense
was in his mind. If actually attacked,
he must defend himself, of course, but he
wished more than anything to drive the intruder
away with no collision. That was
what he hoped for. The time went on, and
the strain upon the doctor&#39;s nerves was
nearly driving him mad. Sometimes the
mare balked for hours. He began to hope
that Aaron would leave her, and return
home on foot. That would settle the matter.
But he remembered a strange trait of obstinacy
in Aaron. He remembered how he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span>
<a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had once actually sat all night in the buggy
while the mare balked. The man balked as
well as the horse. "The damned fool," he
muttered to himself in an agony. The dog
growled in response. Then it was that first
the thought came to Gordon of what might
be done to save them all. He stood aghast
with the horror of it. He was essentially a
man of peace himself, unless driven to the
wall. He was a good fighter at bay, but there
was in his heart, along with strength, utter
good-will and gentleness toward all his kind.
He only wished to go his way in peace, and
for those whom he loved to go in peace, but
that had been denied him. He began considering
the nature of the man whose dark figure
remained motionless on the driveway.
He knew him from the first. It sounded sensational,
his recapitulation of his knowledge,
but it was entirely true. It was that awful
truth, which is past human belief, which no
man dares put into fiction. That man out
there had been from his birth a distinct power
for evil upon the face of the earth. He had
menaced all creation, so far as one personality
may menace it. He was a force of ill, a
moral and spiritual monster, and the more
dangerous, because of a subtlety and resource
<span class="tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span>
<a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which had kept him immune from the
law. He outstripped the law, whose blood-hounds
had no scent keen enough for him.
He had broken the law, but always in such
a way that there was not, and never could be,
any proof. There had not been even suspicion.
There had been knowledge on Gordon&#39;s
part, and Mrs. Swing&#39;s, but knowledge
without proof is more helpless than suspicion
with it. The man was unassailable, free
to go his way, working evil.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again Gordon thought he heard the nearing
trot of a horse, and again the dog growled.
Gordon was not quite sure that time that a
horse had not passed the house. He told himself
in despair that he could not be sure of
knowing when James and Clemency came,
and again the awful thought seized him, and
again he reflected upon the man outside.
Suppose, instead of wearing the semblance
of humanity, he had worn the semblance of a
beast, then his course would have been clear
enough. Suppose it were a hungry wolf
watching out there, instead of a man, and
this man was worse than any wolf. He was
like the weir-wolf of the old Scandinavian
legend. He had all the cowardly cruelty of
a wolf, he was a means of evil, but he had
the trained brain of a man.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span>
<a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon thought he heard footsteps, and
the man made a very slight motion. Gordon
thought joyfully that Aaron had left the
balky mare, and had returned, but it was
not so. He had heard nothing except the
pulsations of the blood in his own overwrought
brain.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He wondered if he were really going mad,
although all the time his mind was steadily
at work upon the awful problem which had
been forced upon it. Should any power for
evil be allowed to exist upon the earth if mortal
man had strength to stamp it out? Suppose
that was a poisonous snake out there,
and not a man. What was out there was
worse than any snake. Gordon reasoned as
the first man in Eden may have reasoned;
and he did not know whether his reasoning
were right or wrong. Meantime, the danger
increased every moment. Of one thing he
was perfectly sure: he had no personal motive
for what he might or might not do. He
had reached that pass when he was himself,
as far as he himself was concerned, beyond
hate of that man outside. It was a principle
for which he argued. Should a monster,
something abnormal in strength and subtlety
and wickedness, something which menaced
<span class="tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span>
<a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all the good in the world, be allowed to exist?
Gordon argued that it should not. He
was driven to it by years of fruitless struggling
against this monstrous creation in the
shape of man. He had seen such suffering
because of him; his whole life had been so
turned and twisted this way and that way
because of him, that he himself had in the
end become abnormal, and mentally askew,
with the system of things. He was conscious
of it himself. He had been naturally a good,
simple, broad-visioned man, full of charity,
with almost no subtlety. He had been forced
to lead a life which strained and diverted all
these good traits. Where he would have been
open, he had been secret. Where he would
have had no suspicion of any one, his first
sight now seemed to be for ulterior motives.
He weighed and measured where he naturally
would have scattered broadcast. He
had been obliged to compress his broad vision
into a narrow window of detection. He was
not the man he had been. Where he had gazed
out of wide doors and windows at life, he
now gazed through keyholes, and despised
himself for so doing. In order to evade the
trouble which had fallen to his lot, he took
refuge in another personality. Thomas Gordon
<span class="tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span>
<a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was a man whom a happy and untroubled
life would have kept from all
worldly blemish. Now the gold was tarnished,
and he himself always saw the tarnish,
as one sees a blur before the eye.
Twenty years before, if any one had told
him that he would at any period of his life
become capable of standing and arguing with
himself as to the right or wrong of what was
now in his mind, he would have been incredulous.
He had in reality become another
man. Circumstances had evolved him,
during the course of twenty years, into something
different, as persistent winds evolve a
pliant tree into another than its typical shape.
Gordon had lost his type.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As he stood at the window the room grew
cold. The hearth fire had died down. He
knew that the furnace needed attention, but
he dared not quit his post and his argument.
He became sure that the maid would not return
that night. He knew that Aaron was
sitting with his human obstinacy behind the
obstinate brute, somewhere on the road. He
knew that James and Clemency might at any
moment drive in, and he might rush out too
late to prevent murder and the kidnapping
of the girl. He knew what the man was
<span class="tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span>
<a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>there for. And he knew the one way to
thwart him, but it was so horrible a way that
it needed all this argument, all this delay and
nearing of danger, before he adopted it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The increasing cold of the room seemed to
act as a sort of physical goad toward action.
"By God, it <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">is</span> right!" he muttered. Then
he looked at the dog crouching still with that
wiry intentness before the door. The dog
came of a good breed of fighters. He was in
himself both weapon and wielder of weapon.
He was a concentrated force. His white body
was knotted with nerves and muscles. The
chances were good if—Gordon pictured it to
himself—and again the horror and doubt
were over him. He himself had acquired a
certain stiffness and lassitude from years,
and long drives in one position. He would
stand no chance unarmed against a bullet.
But the dog—that was another matter. The
dog would make a spring like the spring of
death itself, and that white leap of attack
might easily cause the aim to go wrong. It
would be like aiming at lightning. He knew
how the dog would gather himself together,
all ready for that terrible leap, the second he
opened the door. He knew that he might be
able to open the door for the leap without
<span class="tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span>
<a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attracting the man&#39;s attention, faced as he
was the other way, if he could keep the dog
quiet. He knew how it would be. He could
see that tall dark figure rolled on the drive,
struggling as one struggles with death, for
breath, under the vise-like grip on his throat.
Gordon knew that the dog&#39;s unerring spring
would be for the throat; that was the instinct
of his race, a noble race in its way, to
seize vice and danger by the throat, and attack
the very threshold of life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon returned to the window. It seemed
to him again that he heard a horse&#39;s trot.
He felt sure that it was not the trot of the
gray, who had a slight lameness. He knew
the trot of the gray. He became sure that
James and Clemency would the next moment
enter the drive. He set his mouth
hard, crept toward the dog, and patted him.
As he patted him he felt the rage-crest rise
higher on his back. Gordon bade him be
quiet, and slipped his leash from the staple.
Then he took it from the collar. He listened
again. It seemed to him that his ears could
not deceive him. It seemed to him that James
and Clemency were coming. He was almost
delirious. He fancied he heard their voices
and the girl&#39;s laugh ring out. Holding the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span>
<a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dog firmly by the collar, he rose and very carefully
and noiselessly slipped the bolt of the
door back. Then he waited a second. Then
as slowly and carefully, still holding the dog
by the collar, and whispering commands to
hush his growls, he turned the door knob.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">
<img src="images/image03.png" width="480" height="707" alt="&quot;There was a white flash of avenging brute force upon the man.&quot;" class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"There was a white flash of avenging brute force upon the
man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then the thing was done. He flung the
door open. He saw the man in the drive,
standing with his face toward the road. He
had heard nothing. Then he loosened his
grasp of the straining dog&#39;s collar, and there
was a white flash of avenging brute force
upon the man. Gordon saw only one leap of
the dog before the man was down. A futile
pistol shot rang out. Then came the snarl
and growl of a fighting dog fastened upon his
prey.</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER IX</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Clemency and James returned from
their drive, they saw a glimmer of light between
the house and stable. "Aaron is out
there with a lantern," whispered Clemency.
She sat up straight, leaned into her corner
of the buggy, and adjusted her hat and
straightened her hair with the pretty young
girl motions of secrecy and modesty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James peered ahead into the darkness
through which the lantern moved like a
will-o&#39;-the-wisp. "Your uncle is here, too,"
he said. Then he drew rein with a sudden,
"Halloo, what is wrong?" Aaron came
forward, leaving the lantern on the ground.
It lit weirdly Dr. Gordon, who was kneeling
on the ground beside a dark mass, which
looked horribly suggestive. Then James saw
another dark mass to the right, the balky
mare and a buggy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctor Gordon says you had better hitch
to this post here," said Aaron in a sort of
hoarse whisper, "and then come to him. He
says he needs help, and Miss Clemency, he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span>
<a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>says, must go around the house and in the
front door, and be careful not to let the dog
out, but go upstairs, and if her mother is
awake, tell her it ain&#39;t anything for her to
fret about, and Doctor Gordon will be in very
soon."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Aaron, what is the matter?" said
Clemency, in a frightened whisper, as James
sprang out of the buggy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It ain&#39;t nothin&#39;," replied Aaron doggedly.
"Jest a man fell coming to the office.
Reckon he had a jag on. Doctor says he may
have broke a rib. He&#39;s doctorin&#39; him. You
jest run round the house, and in the front
door, Miss Clemency, and don&#39;t let out the
dog, an&#39; see to your ma."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James assisted Clemency out, and she fled,
with a wild glance over her shoulder at the
lantern-lit group in front of the office door.
While Aaron tied the horse to the post James
ran to Doctor Gordon. When he drew nearer
the sight became sanguinary in its details,
and he could hear from the office the raging
growls and howls of the dog. He also heard
him leap against the door, as if he would
break it down. Gordon had a pail of water
and a basin beside him, and he was applying
water vigorously to the throat of the prostrate
<span class="tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span>
<a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>figure. The water in the basin gleamed, in
the lantern light, blood red. "Just empty
this basin and fill it up from the pail," ordered
Gordon in a husky voice, and again he
squeezed the reddened cloth over the throat,
which James now discerned was badly torn.
The man lay doubled up upon himself as limp
as a rag.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I don&#39;t think so," replied Gordon, as
if in answer to an unspoken question, as
James, having complied with his request,
drew near with the basin of fresh water.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was it the dog?" asked James in a low
voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, the fool came round to the office
door, and—" Gordon stopped with a miserable
sigh which was almost a groan, and
dipped the cloth in the basin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How did you get him off?" asked James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I had the whip, and Aaron came in just
then with that damned mare. She had balked.
I don&#39;t think it is the jugular. It can&#39;t be.
Damn it, how he bleeds! Run into the office,
Elliot, and get the absorbent cotton and the
brandy. I&#39;ve got to stop this somehow. Oh,
my God!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James suddenly recognized the man on the
ground, and gave an exclamation which Gordon
<span class="tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span>
<a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>did not seem to notice. "For God&#39;s
sake, don&#39;t let that dog out!" he cried.
"Don&#39;t risk the office door. Go around the
house, the front way! Be quick!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James obeyed. He rushed around the
house, and opened the front door. Immediately
Clemency was clinging to him in the
dim vestibule. "Mother is asleep. I think
Uncle Tom must have given her some medicine
to make her sleep. Oh, what is the matter?
Who is that man out there, and what
ails him, and what ails the dog? I started to
go in the office, but he leapt against the door,
so I didn&#39;t. I was afraid he might get out
and run upstairs and wake mother. Oh,
what is it all about?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing for you to worry about, dear,"
replied James. "Now you must be a good
little girl, and let me go. Your uncle is in a
hurry for some things in the office." He put
away her clinging arms gently, and hurried
on toward the office, but the girl followed
him. "If I don&#39;t stand ready to shut the
door behind you, that dog will be out," she
said. All at once a conviction as to something
seized her, and she cried out in terror
and horror, "Oh, I know it is that man out
there, and Jack wants to get at him. I
know."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span>
<a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is nothing for you to worry about,
dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know. Is he going to die? Is he hurt
much?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, your uncle doesn&#39;t think so. Don&#39;t
hinder me, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I won&#39;t. I will stand ready and
bang the door together after you before Jack
can get out. Oh, it is that man!" Clemency
was half-hysterical, but she stood her ground.
When James opened the office door cautiously
and slipped through the opening, she pushed
it together with surprising strength. "Don&#39;t
get bitten yourself," she called out anxiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For a moment James thought that he might
be bitten, for the dog was so frenzied that
he was almost past the point of recognizing
his friends. He made a powerful leap upon
James, the crest upon his back as rigid as
steel, but James snatched at his collar, threw
him, and spoke, and the well-trained animal
succumbed before his voice. "Charge!"
thundered the young man, and the dog obeyed,
although still bristling and growling. James
hurriedly caught up his leash and fastened
him to the staple, then he opened the inner
office door, and spoke quickly and reassuringly
to Clemency, who was huddled behind
<span class="tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span>
<a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it shaking with fear. "He is all right. I
have fastened him," he said. "Don&#39;t worry.
Now I must go and help your uncle."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He didn&#39;t bite you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, no, he knew me the minute I spoke.
Sit down here by the fire and don&#39;t be frightened;
that&#39;s a good little girl."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With that James was out by the other door
and in the drive beside Gordon, who was still
assiduously applying water to the red throat
of the prostrate man. "It is beginning to
slack up a little," he said hoarsely. "Here,
give me the cotton, and see if you can&#39;t get
a drop of brandy between his teeth. They
are clinched, but just now he moved a little.
He may be able to swallow. Aaron, put the
team into the wagon, and get a mattress and
some blankets from the storeroom. Hurry,
he may come to himself any minute, and he
must not stay here any longer than necessary."
Gordon was working fiercely as he spoke, and
James took the cork from the brandy flask,
and attempted to force a little between the
man&#39;s clinched teeth. Aaron hurried into
the stable and lit another lantern, and went
about executing his orders. James, kneeling
over the prostrate man, attempting to minister
to him, saw the face fully in the glare
<span class="tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span>
<a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the lantern. The unconscious face did
not look as evil as he remembered it. He
even had a doubt if it were the face of the
man who had that evening stood at his horse&#39;s
head, and so terrified Clemency. Then he became
convinced that it was the same. There
could be no mistaking the features, which
were unusually regular and handsome, but
with a strange peculiarity of lines. It seemed
to James that, even while the man was unconscious,
all his features presented slightly
upturned lines as of bitter derision, intersected
with downward lines of melancholy.
All these lines were very delicate, but they
served to give expression. He looked like a
man who had suffered and made others suffer
for his sufferings, with a cruel enjoyment
at the spectacle. It was a strange face, but
not an evil one. However, after James had
succeeded in forcing a few drops of brandy,
which were met with convulsive swallowing,
between the man&#39;s teeth, he moved again,
and his eyes opened, and immediately the
evil shone out of the face like a malignant
flame in a lamp. Knowledge of, and delight
in, evil gleamed out of the sudden brightness
of the man&#39;s great eyes. Then the evil seemed
to leap to rage, as a spark leaps to flame. He
<span class="tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span>
<a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tried to raise himself, and cursed in a choking
voice. He seemed awake most fully to consciousness,
and to know exactly what had happened.
The dog in the office sent forth a perfect
volley of barks. The man had been
obliged to sink back, but his right hand
fumbled feebly for his pocket.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is not there," Gordon said coolly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Shoot him, you—or—" croaked the man
in his voice of unnatural rage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Time enough for that," said Gordon.
He spoke coolly, but James saw him shaking
as if with the ague. He was deadly white,
and his whole face looked drawn and withered.
Aaron came leading the team harnessed
to the wagon out of the stable. He
had brought down the mattress and blankets,
as the doctor had directed, and the three men
after the rude bed had been made in the
wagon lifted the man thereon. He seemed
to be conscious, but his muttering was so
weak as to be almost inaudible, save for occasional
words.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After he was in the wagon Gordon, turning
to James, said: "You had better go in the
house and stay with the women. Aaron will
go with me. I shall take this man to the
hotel, to Georgie K.&#39;s."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span>
<a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">A perfect volley of mumbled remonstrances
came from the prostrate figure in
the wagon. Gordon seemed to understand
him. "No, I shall not take you there," he
said, "but to the hotel. You will be better
cared for. I know the proprietor."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He got in beside the man, and seated himself
on the floor of the wagon. Aaron mounted to
the driver&#39;s seat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell Clemency and her mother not to
worry if they are awake," Gordon called to
James as the horses started.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James said yes and went into the house.
He entered through the office door, and directly
Clemency was in his arms, all trembling
and half-weeping. "Oh, what has happened?
Has Uncle Tom taken him away?"
she quavered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hush, dear, you will wake your mother.
Yes, he has taken him away."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What was the matter, tell me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He was unconscious. He had fallen."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He came to. I heard him speak. Were
any bones broken?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I think not. You must go to bed; it
it very late, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency had put fresh wood on the hearth,
and the little place was all a-waver and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span>
<a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a-flicker with firelight. Grotesque shadows
danced over the walls and ceiling, and
sprawled uncertainly on the floor. Clemency
looked up in James&#39;s face, and her own
had a shocked whiteness and horror, in spite
of the tenderness in his. "Tell—" she began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What, dear?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was it—that man?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell me," Clemency said imperiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I think it was."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency glanced as if instinctively at the
dog, lying asleep in a white coil on the hearth.
"What was the matter with him?" she asked
in a hardly audible voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He had fallen, dear, and was unconscious."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing—" Clemency glanced again at
the dog, and did not complete her question.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He had recovered consciousness," James
said hastily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then he is not going to die." It was
impossible to say what kind of relief was in
the girl&#39;s voice, but relief there was.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I see no reason why he should. I don&#39;t
think your uncle thought he would die."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where have they taken him?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"To the hotel. Now, Clemency dear, you
<span class="tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span>
<a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>must put all this out of your mind and go to
bed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency obeyed like a child. She kissed
James, took a candle, and went upstairs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James went into his own room, but he did
not undress or go to bed. Instead, he sat at
the window facing the street and stared into
the darkness, watching for Doctor Gordon&#39;s
return. He sat there for nearly two hours,
then he heard wheels, and saw the dark mass
of the team and wagon lumber into sight. He
ran through the house, and was in the drive
with a lantern when the team entered. "Have
you been waiting for us, Elliot?" called Doctor
Gordon&#39;s tired voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I thought I would."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I stayed until I was sure he was comfortable,"
said Gordon. He clambered over
the wheel of the wagon like an old man.
When he was in the office with James, and
the lamp was lit, he sank into a chair, and
looked at the younger man with an expression
almost of despair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He is not going to die of it?" asked
James hesitatingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No," cried Gordon, "he shall not!" He
looked up with sudden, fierce resolution and
alertness. "Why should he die?" he demanded.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span>
<a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>"He is far from being old or
feeble. His vitals are not touched. Why on
earth should you think he would die?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I see no reason," James replied hastily,
"only—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Only what, for God&#39;s sake?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I thought you looked discouraged."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I am, and tired of the world, but
this man is going to live. See here, boy, suppose
you see if there is any hot water in the
kitchen, and we&#39;ll have something to drink,
then we will go to bed, and God grant we
don&#39;t have a night call."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After Gordon had drank his face lightened
somewhat, still he looked years older than he
had done at dinner time, with that awful
aging of the soul, which sometimes comes in
an instant. When finally he went upstairs
James noticed how feebly he moved. It was
on his tongue&#39;s end to offer to assist him,
but he did not dare.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next morning, before James was up,
he heard the rapid trot of a horse on the
drive, and wondered if Doctor Gordon had
had a call so early. When the breakfast-bell
rang only Clemency was at the table. The
maid had returned in season to get breakfast,
and was waiting with a severely interrogative
face.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span>
<a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">She had noticed blood on the frozen surface
of the drive and had stood surveying it before
she entered. She had asked Clemency if anything
had happened, and the girl had told her
that a man had fallen near the office door on
the preceding evening and been injured, and
Doctor Gordon had taken him home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What&#39;s the man&#39;s name?" Emma had inquired
sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know," said Clemency, and indeed
she did not know, but there was something
secretive in her manner. Emma set
her mouth hard and tossed her head. Curiosity
was almost a lust with her. She was always
enraged when it was excited and not
gratified.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When James entered, she glanced severely
at him and then at Clemency, as she passed
the muffins. She suspected something between
them, and she was baffled there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Has Doctor Gordon gone out?" James
asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, he went right out as soon as he got
up. Just had a cup of coffee; wouldn&#39;t wait
for breakfast," replied Emma in a nipping
tone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Neither Clemency nor James made any
comment. Both knew where he had gone,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span>
<a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and Emma, seeing that they both knew, grew
more hostile than ever. Her manner of serving
the beefsteak was fairly warlike.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After breakfast Aaron told James of some
parting instructions which Gordon had left
with him. He had the team harnessed, and
was to take James to visit certain patients.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James went off on a long drive across the
country, calling on his way at the scattered
houses of the patients. He did not return
until noon, just before the luncheon-bell rang.
Entering by the office door he found Gordon
sitting before the hearth-fire, smoking, and
staring gloomily at the leaping flames. He
looked up when James entered, said good
morning in an abstracted fashion, and asked
some questions about the patients whom he
had visited. James hesitated about inquiring
for the man who had been injured the
night before, but finally he did so. The dog
had sprung up to greet him, and between his
pats on the white head and commands of
"Down, sir, down!" he asked as casually
as he could if Gordon had seen his patient
who had fallen in the drive the night before,
and how he was. Gordon turned upon James
a face of such fierce misery that the younger
man fairly recoiled. "He isn&#39;t going to
die?" he cried.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span>
<a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, he is not going to die. He shall not
die!" Gordon replied with passionate emphasis.
Then he added, in response to James&#39;s
wondering, half-frightened look, "I have
been there all the morning. I have just
come home. I have left everything for him.
I don&#39;t dare get a nurse. I am afraid. He
may talk a good deal. Georgie K. is with
him now. I can trust him, but I can&#39;t trust
a nurse. I am going back after luncheon,
and you may go with me. I would like you
to see him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Does he seem to be very ill?" James
asked timidly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not from the—the—wound," replied
Gordon, "but I am afraid of something
else."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Erysipelas. I am afraid of that setting in.
In fact, I am not altogether sure that it has
not. He is an erysipelas subject. He has told
me of two severe attacks which he has had.
When he fell he got an abrasion of the cheek.
That looks worse than the—the—wound. I
should like you to see him. You have seen
erysipelas cases, of course, in your hospital
practice."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, yes."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span>
<a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There is the bell for luncheon. We will
go directly afterward."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James wondered within himself at the feverish
haste with which Gordon swallowed his
luncheon, frequently looking at his watch. He
was actually showing more anxiety over this
man who had hounded him, of whom he had
lived in dread, than James had seen him show
over any patient since he had been with him.
It seemed to him inconsistent. Mrs. Ewing
did not come down to luncheon; Clemency
said that she was not feeling as well as usual
but Gordon did not seem much disturbed even
by that. He gave Clemency some powders,
with instructions how to administer them to
the sick woman before he left, but he did not
show concern, and did not go upstairs to see
her. Clemency herself looked pale and anxious.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She found a chance to whisper to James
before he went. "Is that man very much
hurt?" she said close to his ear.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hush, dear. I am afraid so."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Uncle Tom seems terribly worried. I
have never seen him so worried even over
mother, and he doesn&#39;t seem worried about
her now. Oh, James, she is suffering frightfully,
I know." Clemency gave a little sob.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span>
<a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then Gordon&#39;s voice was heard calling imperiously,
"Elliot, come along!" James
kissed the poor little face tenderly, and
whispered that she must not worry, that probably
the powders would relieve her mother,
and then that she herself had better lie down
and try to get a little sleep, and hurried out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon was seated in the buggy, waiting
for him. "I don&#39;t want to lose any time,"
he said brusquely as James got in beside him.
"Even a few minutes sometimes work awful
changes in a case like this. If he is no
worse I will leave you with him, and make
a call on Mrs. Wells. I haven&#39;t seen her to-day,
and yesterday it looked like pneumonia,
then there is that child with diphtheria at
the Atwaters&#39;. I ought to go there myself,
but if he is worse you will have to go, and to
a few others, and I must stay with him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon drove furiously. Heads appeared
at windows; people on the street turned faces
of wonder and alarm after him. It was soon
noised about Alton that there had been a terrible
accident, that somebody was at the point
of death, but of that Gordon and James knew
nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When they arrived at the hotel, Gordon,
after he had tied his horse, took his medicine-case,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span>
<a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and, followed by James, entered, and
went directly upstairs to a large room at the
back of the hotel. This room was somewhat
isolated in position, having a corridor on one
side and linen closets on another, it being a
corner apartment with two outer walls. Gordon
opened the door softly and entered with
James behind him. The bed stood between
the two west windows. It was a northwest
room. The afternoon sun had not yet reached
it. It was furnished after the usual fashion
of country hotel bedrooms. It was clean and
sparse, and the furniture had the air of having
a past, of having witnessed almost everything
which occurs to humanity. It seemed
battered and stained, though not with wear,
but with humanity. The old-fashioned black
walnut bedstead in which the sick man lay
seemed to have a thousand voices of experiences.
A great piece was broken off one corner
of the footboard. The wound in the wood
looked sinister. Directly opposite the bed
stood the black walnut bureau, with its swung
glass. The glass was cracked diagonally, and
reflected the bed and its occupant with an air
of experience. Gordon went directly to his
patient. Beside him sat Georgie K. He
looked at the two doctors and shook his head
<span class="tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span>
<a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gravely. His great blond face was unshaven
and paled with watching. Nobody spoke a
word. All three looked at the man in the
bed, who lay either asleep, or feigning sleep,
or in a stupor. Gordon felt for his pulse
softly, with keen eyes upon his face. This
face was unspeakably ghastly. The throat
was swathed in bandages. There was one
tiny spot of red on the white of the linen.
The man&#39;s eyes were rolled upward. Around
an abrasion on the cheek, which glistened
oily with some unguent which had been applied
to it, was a circle of painful red clearly
defined from the pallor of the rest of the
cheek.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon spoke. "How do you feel?" he
asked of the man, who evidently heard and
understood, but did not reply. He simply
made a little motion of facial muscles, of
shoulders, of his whole body under the bed-clothes,
which indicated rage and impatience.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Does that place on your cheek burn?"
asked Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again there was no answer, this time not
even any motion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Have you any pain?" asked Gordon.
The man lay motionless. "Is there any one
in the parlor?" Gordon asked abruptly of
Georgie K.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span>
<a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, Doc. You can go right in there."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon beckoned to James, and the two
went downstairs, and entered the room of the
wax flowers and the stuffed canary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It looks like erysipelas," Gordon said
with no preface.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All I have done so far, in the absence of
any positive proof of the truth of that diagnosis,
is to apply what you will think an old
woman&#39;s remedy, but I have known it to give
good results in light cases, and I did not like
to resort to the more strenuous methods until
I was sure of my ground, for fear of complications.
I applied a little mutton tallow,
and that was all, but the inflammation has increased
since I saw him. It now looks to me
like a clearly defined case of erysipelas."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It does to me," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So far—the—wound in the throat seems
to be doing well," said Gordon gloomily.
Then he looked at the younger physician
with an odd, helpless expression. "His life
must be saved," said he. "Which do you
prefer of the two methods of treating the
disease—that is, of the two primary ones?
Of course, there are methods innumerable. I
may have grown rusty in my country practice.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span>
<a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Do you prefer the leaches, the nitrate
of silver, the low diet, or the reverse?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think I prefer the reverse."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, you may be right," said Gordon,
"and yet you have to consider that this is
a man in full vigor," he added, "that presumably
he has considerable reserve strength
upon which to draw. Still if you prefer the
other treatment—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have seen very good results from it,"
said James. He was becoming more and more
astonished at the older man&#39;s helpless, almost
appealing, manner toward himself.
"What is the man&#39;s name?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know what name he has given
here," Gordon replied evasively. "I will tell
you later on what his name is."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly the parlor door was flung open,
and a woman appeared. She was middle-aged,
very large, clad in black raiment, which
had an effect of sliding and slipping from her
when she moved. She kept clutching at the
buttons of her coat, which did not quite meet
over her full front. She brought together the
ends of a black fur boa, she reached constantly
for the back of her skirts, and gave
them a firm tug which relaxed the next moment.
Her decent black bonnet was askew,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span>
<a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her large face was flushed. She had been a
strapping, handsome country girl once; now
she was almost indecent in her involuntary
exuberance of coarse femininity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How do you do, Mrs. Slocum?" Doctor
Gordon said politely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James rose, Gordon introduced him. Mrs.
Slocum did not bow, she jerked her great chin
upward, then she spoke with really alarming
ferocity. "Where has my boarder went?
That&#39;s what I want to know. That&#39;s what I
have come here for, not for no bowin&#39;s and
scrapin&#39;s. Where has my boarder went?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A keen look came into Gordon&#39;s face. "I
don&#39;t know who your boarder is, Mrs. Slocum,"
he said.</p>
</div>

<a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER X</h1>


<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Slocum looked at the doctor with a
wide gape of surprise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Thought you knew," said she. "His
name is Meserve, Mr. Edward Meserve, and
if he has come and went, and not told where,
he was good pay, and if he was took sick
whilst he was to my house, I could have
asked twice as much as I did before. I&#39;d
like to know what right you had to take my
boarder to the hotel. He was my boarder.
He wan&#39;t your boarder. I want him fetched
right back. That&#39;s what I have came for."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mrs. Slocum," said Gordon in a hard
voice, "Mr. Meserve is too sick to be moved,
and his disease may be contagious. You
might lose all your other boarders, and
whether he recovers or not, you would be
obliged to fumigate your house, and have his
room repapered and plastered."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He&#39;s got money enough to pay for it,"
Mrs. Slocum said doggedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How do you know?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You think he ain&#39;t?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span>
<a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon looked imperturbable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He always paid me regular, and he ain&#39;t
been to meals or to home nights two-thirds of
the time."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon said nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You mean if my other boarders went, and
the room had to be done over, he ain&#39;t got
money enough to make it good?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon said nothing. The woman fidgeted.
"Well," said she, "if there&#39;s any doubt of
it, mebbe he <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">is</span> better off here." Suddenly she
gave a suspicious glance at Gordon. "Say,"
said she, "the room here will have to be done
over. Who&#39;s goin&#39; to pay for that?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The room is isolated," replied Gordon
briefly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The woman stared. She evidently did not
know the meaning of the word.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well," said she at last, "if the room <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">is</span>
insulted, it will have to be done over. Who&#39;s
going to pay for that?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t pay
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">me</span> for that as well as Mr. Evans."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I do. Now, Mrs. Slocum, I really
have no more time to waste. Mr. Meserve is
<span class="tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span>
<a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a very sick man, and I have to go to him. I
came down here to consult with my assistant,
and you have hindered us. Good-day!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the woman still stood her ground.
"I&#39;m goin&#39; to see him," she said. "He&#39;s
my boarder."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You will do so at your own risk, and also,
if your call should prove injurious to him, at
a risk of being indicted for manslaughter, besides
possibly catching the disease."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You say it&#39;s ketching?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I said it might be. We have not yet entirely
formed our diagnosis."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The woman stared yet again. Then she
turned about with a switch which disclosed
fringy black petticoats and white stockings.
"Well, form your noses all you want to,"
said she. "You have took away my boarder,
an&#39; if he gits well, and it ain&#39;t ketchin&#39;, I&#39;ll
have the law on ye."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon drew a deep breath when the door
closed behind her. "It seems sometimes to
me as if comedy were the haircloth shirt of
tragedy," he said grimly. "Well, Elliot,
we will go upstairs and begin the fight. I
am going to fight to the death. I shall remain
here to-night. You will have to look
after my other patients when you leave here.
I am sorry to put so much upon you."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span>
<a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, that&#39;s all right," said James, following
Gordon upstairs. But as he spoke he
wondered more and more that this man,
after what he had known of him, should be
of more importance to Gordon than all others.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Even during the short time they had been
downstairs the angry red around the abrasion
on the cheek had widened, and widened
toward the head. Gordon opened his medicine-case
and took out a bottle and hairbrush
and commenced work. Directly the
entire cheek was blackened with the application
of iron. Georgie K. had brought glasses,
and medicine had been forced into the patient&#39;s
mouth. "Now go and have some eggnog
mixed, Georgie K.," said Gordon, "and
bring it here yourself, if you will. I hate to
trouble you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s all right, Doc," said Georgie K.,
and went.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James remained only a short time, since he
had the other calls to make. He returned
quite late to find that dinner had been kept
waiting for him, and Clemency in her pretty
red gown was watching. Mrs. Ewing had
not come down all day. "Mother says she
is easier," Clemency observed, "only she
thinks it better to keep perfectly still."
<span class="tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span>
<a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Clemency said very little about the man at
the hotel. She seemed to dread the very
mention of him. She and James spent a long
evening together, and she was entirely charming.
James began to put behind him all the
mystery and dark hints of evil. Clemency,
although fond, was as elusive as a butterfly.
She had feminine wiles to her finger tips, but
she was quite innocent of the fact that they
were wiles. It took the whole evening for the
young man to secure a kiss or two, and have
her upon his knee for the space of about five
minutes. She nestled closely to him with a
little sigh of happiness for a very little while,
then she slipped away, and stood looking at
him like an elf. "I am not going to do that
much," said she.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why not, darling?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Because I am not. It is silly. I love you,
but I will not be silly. I want only what will
last. The love will last, but the silliness
won&#39;t. We are going to be married, but I
shall not want to sit on your knee all the time,
and what is more, you will not want me to.
Suppose we should live to be very old. Who
ever saw a very old woman sitting on her
very old husband&#39;s knee? The love will last,
but that will not. We will not have so very
much of that which will not last."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span>
<a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">For all that, James caught Clemency and
kissed her until her soft face was crimson, but
he said to himself, when he was in his own
room, that never was a girl so wise, and how
much more he wanted to hold her upon his
knee—as if he had not already held her there—and
yet she was not coquettish. She was
simply earnest, with an odd, wise, childlike
earnestness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Early the next morning James went to the
hotel, and found Gordon haggard and intense,
sitting beside his patient, who was evidently
worse. The terrible red fire of Saint Anthony
had mounted higher, and settled lower.
"It has attacked his throat now," Gordon
said in a whisper. "I expect every minute
it will reach his brain. When it does, nobody
but you and I must be with him, not even
Georgie K. He is getting some rest. He
was up half the night, bless him! But when
it reaches the brain two will be needed here,
and the two must be you and I. Take this
list, and make the calls as quickly as you can,
and come back here." James, with a last
glance at the black and swollen face of the
man, who now seemed to be in a state of coma,
obeyed. He hurried through his list, and returned.
He found no apparent change in the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span>
<a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>patient, and tried to persuade Gordon to
take a little rest, but the elder man was obdurate.
"No" he said, "here I stay. I have
had a bit to eat and drink. You go down yourself
and get something, then come back. The
crisis may arrive any second. Then I shall
need you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fire had outstripped the blackness on
the man&#39;s cheek toward the temple. One eye
was closed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When James returned after a hurried
lunch, he heard a loud, terrible voice in the
room. Outside the door a maid stood with
a horrified face listening. James grasped
her roughly by the shoulder. "Get out of
this," he ordered. "If I find you or any one
else here listening, you&#39;ll be sorry for it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The maid gasped out an excuse and fled.
James tried the door, but it was locked. "Is
that you, Elliot?" called Gordon above the
other awful voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The door was unlocked, and James sprang
into the room, but he was hardly quick enough,
for the man was almost out of bed, when the
two doctors forced him back with all their
strength. Then he sat up and raved, and
such raving! James felt his very blood cold
<span class="tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span>
<a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>within him. Revelations as of a devil were
in those ravings. Once in a while James
opened the door cautiously to be sure that
no one was listening. The raving man reiterated
names as of a multitude. Gordon&#39;s
was among them, and many names of women,
one especially—Catherine. He repeated that
name more frequently than the others, but the
others were legion. There was something indescribably
horrible in hearing this repetition
of names of unknown people, accompanied
with statements beyond belief regarding them
and the raving man. Gordon&#39;s face was
ghastly, and so was the younger doctor&#39;s.
"Look and see if any one is listening, for
God&#39;s sake," Gordon gasped, after one terrific
outburst, and James looked, but Georgie
K. was keeping watch that nobody approached
the door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James never knew how long he was in that
room with Gordon listening to those frenzied
ravings, and striving with him to keep the
man from injuring himself. The daylight
waned, James lighted a lamp. Then a mighty
creaking was heard outside, and Georgie K.,
himself bearing a great supper tray, knocked
at the door. "It&#39;s me, and I brought you
something," he shouted, and then they heard
<span class="tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span>
<a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his retreating footsteps. Much delicacy was
there in Georgie K., and much affection for
Doctor Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James brought in the tray, and now and
then he and Gordon took advantage of a slight
lull to take a bite, but neither had any desire
for food. It was only the instinctive sense
that they must keep up their strength in order
that nobody else should hear what they
were hearing, that forced them to eat and
drink. Well into the evening the ravings
stopped suddenly, the man fell back upon his
pillow, and lay still. James thought at first
that all was over, but presently stertorous
breathing began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now get Georgie K. up," Gordon said
hoarsely. "There is no further need for us
to be alone, and there will be directions to be
given."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James went out and found Georgie K. sitting
up in his bar-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctor Gordon wants you," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How is he?" asked Georgie K., following
James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dying."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Georgie K. made an indescribable sound in
his throat as the two men ascended the stair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man was a long time dying. It seemed
<span class="tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span>
<a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to James as if that awful struggle of the soul
for release from the body would never cease.
He knew, or thought he knew, that there was
no suffering to the dying man, but, after all,
the sounds as of suffering seemed almost to
prove it. Gordon whispered for a while to
Georgie K., as if the dying man might be disturbed
by audible speech. Then Georgie K.
tiptoed out in his creaking boots, and James
knew that some arrangements were to be perfected
for the last services to the dead. Gordon
stood over the bed, with his own face as
ghastly as that of its occupant. James dared
not speak to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was midnight when the dreadful breathing
ceased, and there was silence. Georgie K.
had returned. The three living men looked at
one another with ghastly understanding of
what had happened, then they hastily arranged
some matters. The dead man was decently
composed and dressed, his throat swathed
anew in linen handkerchiefs, and another
handkerchief laid over the discolored face,
which had in death a strange peace, as if relieved
of an uneasy and wearing tenant. Before
Georgie K. went out, the village undertaker
had been summoned, and had been
waiting for some time in the parlor with a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span>
<a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>young assistant. They mounted the stairs
bearing some appurtenances of their trade.
Gordon addressed the undertaker briefly, giving
some directions, then he motioned to
James, and they passed out. Georgie K. remained
in the room. He prevented the undertaker
from removing the linen swathe on the
dead man&#39;s throat. "Doc says it&#39;s catching,"
he said, and the undertaker drew back
quickly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Gordon and James were in the buggy
on the way home, Gordon all at once gave a
great sigh, like that of a swimmer who yields
to the force of the current, or the fighter who
sinks before his opponent. "I&#39;m about done,
too," he said. "Here, take the lines, Elliot."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James took the reins and looked anxiously
at his companion&#39;s face, a pale blue in the
moonlight. "You are not ill?" he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, only done up. For God&#39;s sake let
me rest, and don&#39;t talk till we get home!"
James drove on. Gordon&#39;s head sank upon
his breast, and he began to breathe regularly.
He did not wake until James roused
him when they reached home.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">     *     *     *     *     *</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next morning before breakfast James
was awakened by a loud voice in the office,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span>
<a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the high-pitched one of a woman. He recalled
how exhausted Doctor Gordon had been the
night before, and rose and dressed quickly.
When he entered the office Gordon was sitting
huddled up in his old armchair before
the fire, while bolt upright beside him sat
Mrs. Slocum, discoursing in loud and angry
tones, which Gordon seemed scarcely to heed.
When James entered she turned upon him.
"Now I&#39;ll see if I can git anythin&#39; out of
you," she said. "He" (pointing to Gordon)
"don&#39;t act as if he was half-alive. I&#39;m goin&#39;
to have my rights if I have to go to law to git
&#39;em. Doctor Gordon took away my boarder.
And if I&#39;d had him sick and die to my house,
I could have got extra. Now what I want is
jest this, an&#39; I&#39;m goin&#39; to hev it, too! Doctor
Gordon said Mr. Meserve didn&#39;t have
money. I don&#39;t know nothin&#39; about that. I
ain&#39;t went through his pockets, but his trunk
is to my house, and there&#39;s awful nice men&#39;s
clothes into it, and I mean to hev &#39;em. That
ain&#39;t nothin&#39; more&#39;n fair. That&#39;s what I hev
came here for, jest as soon as I heard the poor
man had passed away. I left my daughter to
git the breakfast for the boarders, and I hev
came here to see about that trunk, and hisn&#39;s
clothes."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span>
<a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">James laughed. "But, Mrs. Slocum," he
said, "what on earth do you want with men&#39;s
clothes? You can&#39;t wear them."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To his intense surprise the great face of
the woman suddenly reddened like that of a
young girl, but the next moment she gave her
head a defiant toss, and stared boldly at him.
"What if I can&#39;t?" said she. "There&#39;s
other men as can wear &#39;em, and they&#39;ll jest
fit Bill Todd. He&#39;s been boardin&#39; with me
five year, and if he wants to git married and
save his board bill, it&#39;s his business and mine
and nobody else&#39;s."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James turned to Gordon, who seemed prostrated
before this feminine onslaught. "Do
you object to this woman&#39;s having the
trunk?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon made an effort and roused himself.
"She can have it after I have examined it for
papers," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There ain&#39;t a scrap of writin&#39; in the
trunk," Mrs. Slocum vociferated. "Me an&#39;
my boarder hev looked. There ain&#39;t no writin&#39;
an&#39; no jewelry, an&#39; no money. He used to
carry his money with him, and he had a bank
book in his pocket, and a long, red book he
used to git money out of the bank. I&#39;ve seen
&#39;em. Doctor Gordon said he didn&#39;t have no
<span class="tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span>
<a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>money. He did hev money. Once he left the
long, red book on his bureau, and I looked in
it, and the leaves that are as good as money
wan&#39;t a quarter torn out. I know he had
money, an&#39; I&#39;ve been cheated out of it. But
all I ask is that trunk."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"For God&#39;s sake take the trunk and clear
out," shouted Gordon with unexpected violence,
"but if there is a scrap of written paper
in that trunk, and you keep it, you&#39;ll be
sorry."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There ain&#39;t," said the woman with evident
truthfulness. She rose and clutched at
the back of her skirt, and tugged at her boa
and coat. "Thank you, Doctor Gordon,"
said she. "When is the funeral goin&#39; to be?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell her to-morrow at two o&#39;clock at the
hotel, and tell her to leave," said Gordon,
and his voice was suddenly apathetic again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When the woman had gone Gordon turned
to James. "How comedy will prick through
tragedy," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes," James answered vaguely. He
looked anxiously at Gordon, whose eyes had
at once a desperate and an utterly wearied
appearance. "I will make all the arrangements
for the funeral, if you wish, Doctor
Gordon," he said. "I know the undertaker,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span>
<a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and I can manage it as well as you. You
look used up."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am pretty nearly," muttered Gordon.
Then he gave an almost affectionate glance at
James. "Do you think you can manage it?"
he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James smiled. "It is a new thing to me, but
I have no doubt I can," he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You cannot imagine what a weight you
would take off my shoulders. Don&#39;t spare
money. See to it that everything is good and
as it should be. The bills are to be sent to
me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon answered an unspoken question of
James. "Yes," he said, "he had money, a
considerable fortune, and he has no heirs—at
least, I am as sure as I need be that he has
none. In his pockets were two bank books,
small check books, and a security register
book. I have done them up in a parcel. See
to it that they are buried with him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, yes, I know. Sooner or later there
will be advertisements in the papers, and that
sort of thing, but that will pass. God knows
I would not touch his money with the devil&#39;s
pitchfork, nor allow anybody whom I loved
to touch it. Let him be buried under the name
<span class="tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span>
<a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by which he was known here. It is not the
name, needless to say, on the bank books.
While living under other than his rightful
name, he must have gone to New York in
person to supply himself with cash. There
was some two hundred dollars in bank notes
in his wallet. That is with the other things.
Let the whole be buried with him, and see to
it that Drake does not discover it. You had
better take the parcel now. Open the right
drawer of the table, and you will find it in
the corner. Then, after breakfast, you had
better see Drake at once. I will attend to
the patients to-day."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are not able."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Able is a word which I have eliminated
from my vocabulary as applied to myself."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The funeral, which was held the next
afternoon in the parlor of the hotel, was at
once a ghastly and a grotesque function.
The two doctors, the undertaker and his assistant,
Georgie K. and the bar-tender, and
Mrs. Slocum with a female friend, and a
man, evidently the boarder to whom she had
referred, were the only persons present. The
boarder wore a hat which had belonged to
the dead man. It was many sizes too large
for his grayish blond, foolish little head,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span>
<a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and, when he put it on, it nearly obscured his
eyes. Mrs. Slocum sniffed audibly through
the service, which was short, being conducted
by the old Presbyterian clergyman of Alton.
He hardly spoke above a whisper of "the
stranger who had passed from our midst into
the beyond." His concluding prayer was
quite inaudible. Mrs. Slocum had brought
a bouquet of cheerful pink geraniums from
her window plants, which on the top of the
closed black casket made an odd spot of color
and life in the dim room. Among the blossoms
were some rose-geranium leaves, whose
fragrance seemed to mantle everything like
smoke. While the clergyman conducted the
inaudible services loud voices were heard in
the bar-room, and the yelp of a dog. On
one side of the house was the hush of death,
on the other the din of life. James wondered
what the clergyman found to say: all that he
had distinguished was the expression, "The
stranger within our midst."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It all seemed horribly farcical to him. The
dead man in his casket had no personality
for him; the sniffs of Mrs. Slocum, her
boarder with the hat, assumed, in his eyes,
the character of a "Punch and Judy" show.
But along with that feeling came the realization
<span class="tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span>
<a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a most terrible pathos. He felt a sort
of pity for the dead man, whose very personality
had become nothing to him, and the
pity was the greater because of that. It became
a pity for the very scheme of things, for
man in the abstract, born perhaps, through no
fault of his own, to sin and misery, both miserable
and causing misery throughout his life,
and then to end in the grave, and vanish from
the sight and minds of other men. He felt
that it would not be so sad if it were sadder,
if Mrs. Slocum&#39;s sniffs had come from her
heart, and not from her sentimentality. He
felt that a funeral where love is not is the
most mournful function on earth. Then, too,
he felt a great anxiety for Doctor Gordon,
who sat shrugged up in his gray overcoat,
with his gray grizzle of beard meeting the
collar, and his forehead heavily corrugated
over pent and gloomy eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was heartily glad when the service was
over, when the casket had been lowered into
the grave, when the village hearse had turned
off into a street, the horse going at a sharp trot,
and he and Doctor Gordon were left alone.
He drove. Gordon sat hunched into a corner
of the buggy, as he had sat in the corner of
the hotel parlor. James hesitated about saying
<span class="tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span>
<a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>anything, but finally he spoke, he felt foolishly
enough, although he meant the words to
be comforting. "You did all you could to
save his life," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon made no reply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When they reached the house, Clemency&#39;s
head disappeared from the window, where
she had evidently been watching. She met
them at the office door, with an odd, shocked,
inquiring expression on her little face. James
kissed her furtively, while Gordon&#39;s back was
turned, as he divested himself of his gray coat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dinner is nearly ready," Clemency said
in an agitated voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How is she?" asked Gordon, then before
she had time to reply, he added almost
roughly, "What on earth are you fretting
about?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not fretting," Clemency answered in
a weak little voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There is nothing in all this for you to concern
yourself with. Put it out of your head!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, Uncle Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How is she?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She has been asleep all the afternoon."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She has not had another attack?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, Uncle Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then the dinner-bell rang.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span>
<a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">To James&#39;s surprise, but everything surprised
him now, Gordon seemed to recover
his spirits. He ate heartily. He laughed
and joked. After dinner he went upstairs
to see Mrs. Ewing, and when he came down
insisted that James should accompany him
to the hotel for a game of euchre. James
would have preferred remaining with Clemency,
whose eyes were wistful, but Gordon
hurried him away. They remained until
nearly midnight in the parlor, where the
funeral had taken place a short time before,
playing euchre, telling stories, and drinking
apple-jack. James noticed that the hotel
man often cast an anxious and puzzled glance
at Gordon. He began to fancy that what
seemed mirth and jollity was the mere bravado
of misery and a ghastly mask of real
enjoyment. He was glad when Gordon made
the move to leave. Georgie K. stood in the
door watching the two men untie the horse
and get into the buggy. "Take care of yourself,
Doc," he hallooed, and there was real
affection and concern in his voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon drove now, and the mare, being on
her homeward road, made good time. James
helped Gordon unharness, as Aaron had gone
to bed. His deep snores sounded through the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span>
<a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stable from his room above. "It&#39;s a pity to
wake up anything," Gordon said. "Guess
well put the mare up ourselves." Now his
voice was bitter again. Gordon had the key
of the office door, and after locking the stable
the two men entered. Gordon threw some
wood on the fire. The lamp with its dangling
prisms was burning. "Sit down a minute,"
Gordon said, "&#39;I have something to tell you.
I may as well get it off my mind now. It has
got to come sometime."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James sat down and lit a cigar. He felt
himself in a nervous tension. Gordon filled
his pipe and lit it, then he began to speak in
an odd, monotonous voice, as though he were
reciting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That man&#39;s name was James Mendon.
He was an Englishman. When I first began
practice it was in the West. That man had a
ranch near the little town where I lived with
my sister Alice. Alice was a beautiful girl.
We had lost our parents, and she kept house
for me. The man was as handsome as a devil,
and he had the devil&#39;s own way with women.
God only knows what a good girl like my sister
saw in him. He had a bad name, even out in
that rough country. Horrible tales were circulated
about his cruelty to animals for one
<span class="tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span>
<a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thing. His cowboys deserted him and told
stories. His very dog turned on him, and
bit him. God knows how he was torturing
the animal. I saw the scar on his hand when
he lay on his death-bed. Well, however it
was, my sister loved him and married him,
and he treated her like a fiend. She died,
and it was a merciful release. He deserted
her three months before her death. Sold
out all he had, and left her without a cent.
She came back to me, and three months later
Clemency was born."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon paused and looked at James.
"Yes," he said, "that man was Clemency&#39;s
father."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He waited, but only for a second. The
young man spoke, and his clear young voice
rang out like a trumpet. "I never loved
Clemency as I love her now," he said.</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER XI</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon smiled at James. "God bless you,
boy!" he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What possible difference do you think
that could make?" demanded James hotly.
"Could that poor little girl help it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course she could not, but some men
might object, and with reason, to marrying a
girl who came of such stock on her father&#39;s
side."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not one of those men."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I don&#39;t think you are, but it is only
my duty to put the case plainly before you.
That man who was buried this afternoon was
simply unspeakable. He was a monstrosity
of perverted morality. I cannot even bring
myself to tell you what I know of him. I
cannot even bring myself to give you the least
hint of what my poor young sister, Clemency&#39;s
mother, suffered in her brief life with him.
You may fear heredity—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Heredity, nothing! Don&#39;t I know Clemency?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I myself really think that you have nothing
<span class="tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span>
<a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whatever to fear. Clemency is her mother&#39;s
living and breathing image as far as looks
go, and as far as I can judge in the innermost
workings of her mind. I have not seen
in her the slightest taint from her evil father,
though God knows I have watched for
it with horror as the years have passed.
After she was born I smuggled her away by
night, and gave out word that the child had
died at the same time with the mother. There
was a private funeral, and the casket was
closed. I had hard work to carry it through
successfully, for I was young in those days,
and broken-hearted at losing my sister, but
carry it through I did, and no one knew except
a nurse. I trusted her, I was obliged to
do so, and I fear that she has betrayed me. I
established a practice in another town in another
State, and there I met Clara. She has
told me that she informed you of the fact that
she was my wife, but not of our reasons for
concealing it. Just before we were married
I became practically certain that Clemency&#39;s
father had gained in some way information
that led him to suspect, if not to be absolutely
certain, that his child had not died with his
wife. I had a widowed sister, Mrs. Ewing,
who lived in Iowa with her only daughter just
<span class="tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span>
<a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>about Clemency&#39;s age. Just before our marriage
she decided to remove to England to live
with some relatives of her deceased husband.
They had considerable property, and she had
very little. I begged her to go secretly, or
rather to hint that she was going East to live
with me, which she did. Nobody in the little
Iowa village, so far as I knew, was aware of
the fact that my sister and daughter had gone
to England, and not East to live with me.
Clara and I were married privately in an obscure
little Western hamlet, and came East
at once. We have lived in various localities,
being driven from one to another by the danger
of Clemency&#39;s father ascertaining the
truth; and my wife has always been known as
Mrs. Ewing, and Clemency as her daughter.
It has been a life of constant watchfulness
and deception, and I have been bound hand
and foot. Even had Clemency&#39;s father not
been so exceedingly careful that it would
have been difficult to reach him by legal
methods, there was the poor child to be considered,
and the ignominy which would come
upon her at the exposure of her father. I
have done what I could. I am naturally a
man who hates deception, and wishes above
all things to lead a life with its windows open
<span class="tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span>
<a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and shades up, but I have been forced into
the very reverse. My life has been as closely
shuttered and curtained as my house. I have
been obliged to force my own wife to live
after the same fashion. Now the cause for
this secrecy is removed, but as far as she is
concerned, the truth must still be concealed
for Clemency&#39;s sake. It must not be known
that that dead man was her father, and the
very instant we let go one thread of the mystery
the whole fabric will unravel. Poor
Clara can never be acknowledged openly as
my wife, the best and most patient wife a
man ever had, and under a heavier sentence
of death this moment than the utmost ingenuity
of man could contrive." Gordon
groaned, and let his head sink upon his hands.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She told me some time ago that she was
ill," James said pityingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ill? She has been upon the executioner&#39;s
block for years. It is not illness; that is too
tame a word for it. It is torture, prolonged
as only the evil forces of Nature herself can
prolong it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon rose and shook himself angrily.
"I am keeping her now almost constantly
under morphine," he said. "She has suffered
more lately. The attacks have been
<span class="tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span>
<a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more frequent. There has never been the
slightest possibility of a surgical operation.
From the very first it was utterly hopeless,
and if it had been the dog there, I should
have put a bullet through his head and considered
myself a friend." Gordon gazed with
miserable reflection at the dog. "I am glad
that the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">direct</span> cause of that man&#39;s death was
not what it might have been," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He shook himself again as a dog shakes
off water. He laughed a miserable laugh.
"Well," he said, "Clemency is free now. She
can go her ways as she will. You see she resembled
her mother so closely that I had to
guard her from even the sight of her father.
He would have known the truth at once. Clemency
is free, but I have paid an awful price
for her freedom and for your life. If I had
not done what you doubtless know I did that
night, you would have been shot, and it would
have been a struggle between myself and her
father, with the very good chance of my
being killed, and Clara and the girl left defenseless.
His revolver carried six deaths in
it. It would all have depended upon the
quickness of the dog, and I should have left
too much hanging upon that."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t see what else you could do,"
<span class="tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span>
<a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>James said in a low voice. He was pale himself.
He did not blame Gordon. He felt
that he himself, in Gordon&#39;s place, would
have done as he had done, and yet he felt as
if faced close to a horror of murder and
death, and he knew from the look upon the
other man&#39;s countenance that it was the same
with him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I saw no other way," Gordon said in a
broken voice, "but—but I don&#39;t know whether
I am a murderer or an executioner, and I
never shall know. God help me! Well," he
added with a sigh, "what is done, is done.
Let us go to bed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James said when they parted at his room
door that he hoped Mrs. Ewing would have a
comfortable night.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, she will," replied Gordon quietly.
Then he gave the young man&#39;s hand a warm
clasp. "God bless you!" he whispered. "If
this had turned you against the child, it
would have driven me madder than I am
now. I love her as if she were my own. You
and your loyalty are all I have to hold to."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You can hold to that to the end," James
returned with warmth, and he looked at Gordon
as he might have looked at his own father.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Late as it was, he wrote that night to his
<span class="tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span>
<a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>own father and mother, telling them of his
engagement to Clemency. There now can be
no possible need for secrecy with regard to
it. James, in spite of his vague sense of horror,
felt an exhilaration at the thought that
now all could be above board, that the shutters
could be flung open. He felt as if an
incubus had rolled from his mental consciousness.
Clemency herself experienced something
of the same feeling. She appeared at
the breakfast-table the next morning with
her hat. "Uncle says I may go with you on
your rounds," she said to James. She beamed,
and yet there was a troubled and puzzled expression
on her pretty face. When she and
James had started, and were moving swiftly
along the country road, she said suddenly,
"Will you tell me something?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Will you?" she repeated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t promise, dear," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why not?" she asked pettishly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Because it might be something which I
ought not to tell you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You ought to tell me everything if—if—"
she hesitated, and blushed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If what?" asked James tenderly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She nestled up to him. "If you—feel toward
me as you say you do."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span>
<a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If. Oh, Clemency!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then you ought to tell me. No, you
needn&#39;t kiss me. I want you to tell me something.
I don&#39;t want to be kissed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, what is that you want to know,
dear?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Will you promise to tell me?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, dear, I can&#39;t promise, but I will tell
you if I am able without doing you harm."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who was that man who was buried yesterday,
who had been hunting me so long,
and frightening me and Uncle Tom, and why
have I been compelled to stay housed as if I
were a prisoner so much of my life?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Because you were in danger, dear, from
the man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are answering me in a circle." Clemency
sat upright and looked at James, and
the blue fire in her eyes glowed. "Who was
the man?" she asked peremptorily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t tell you, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But you know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why can&#39;t you tell me then?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Because it is not best."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency shrugged her shoulders. "Why
did he hunt me so?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t tell you, dear."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span>
<a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But you know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not sure."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But you think you know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then tell me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When will you tell me?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Never!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency looked at him, and again she
blushed. "You will tell me after—we are—married.
You will have to tell me everything
then," she whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James shook his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Won&#39;t you then?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, dear, I shall never tell you while I
live."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency made a sudden grasp at the reins.
"Then I will never marry you," she said.
"I will never marry you, if you keep things
from me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I will never keep things from you that
you ought to know, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I ought to know this!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James remained silent. Clemency had
brought the horse to a full stop. "Won&#39;t
you ever tell me?" she asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, never! dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then let me get out. This is Annie Lipton&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span>
<a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>street. I am going to see her. I have
not seen her for a long time. I will walk
home. It is safe enough now. You can tell
me that much?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, it is, but Clemency, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not Clemency, dear. I am not
going to marry you. You say you wrote your
father and mother last night that we were
going to get married. Well, you can just write
again and tell them we are not. No, you need
not try to stop me. I will get out. Good-by!
I shall not be home to luncheon. I shall stay
with Annie. I like her very much better than
I like you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With that Clemency had slipped out of the
buggy and hurried up a street without looking
back. James drove on. He felt disturbed,
but not seriously so. It was impossible
to take Clemency&#39;s anger as a real thing.
It was so whimsical and childish. He had
counted upon his long morning with her, but
he went on with a little smile on his face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was half inclined to think, so slightly
did he estimate Clemency&#39;s anger, that she
would not keep her word, and would be home
for luncheon. But when he returned she was
not there, and she had not come when the bell
rang.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span>
<a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, where is Clemency?" Gordon said,
when they entered the dining-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She insisted upon stopping to see her
friend Miss Lipton," said James. "She said
that she might not be home to lunch." Emma
gave one of her sharp, baffled glances at him,
then, having served the two men, she tossed
her head and went out. Nobody knew how
much she wished to listen at the kitchen door,
but she was above such a course.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency and I had a bit of a tiff," James
explained to Gordon. "She seemed vexed
because I would not tell her what you told me
last night. She is curious to know more about—that
man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She must not know," Gordon said quickly.
"Never mind if she does seem a little vexed.
She will get over it. I know Clemency. She is
like her mother. The power of sustained indignation
against one she loves is not in the
child, and she must not know. It would be a
dreadful thing for her to know. I myself cannot
have it. It is enough of a horror as it is,
but to have that child look at me, and think—"
Gordon broke off abruptly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She will never know through me," James
said, "and I think with you that her resentment
will not last."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span>
<a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She will be home this afternoon," said
Gordon, "and the walk will do her good."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the two returned from their afternoon
calls, and still Clemency had not returned.
Emma met them at the door. "Mrs. Ewing
says she is worried about Miss Clemency,"
she said. Gordon ran upstairs. When he
came down he joined James in the office. "I
have pacified Clara," he said, "but suppose
you jump into the buggy, Aaron has not unharnessed
yet, and drive over to Annie Lipton&#39;s
for her. It is growing colder, and
Clemency has not been outdoors much lately,
and she has rather a delicate throat. It is
time now that she was home."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James smiled. "Suppose she will not come
with me?" he suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nonsense," said Gordon. "She will be
only too glad if you meet her half-way. She
will come. Tell her I said that she must."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All right," replied James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He went out, got into the buggy, and drove
along rapidly. He had the team, and the
horses were still quite fresh, as they had not
been long distances that day. There was a
vague fear in the young man&#39;s mind, although
he tried to dispel it by the force of
argument. "What has the girl to fear now?"
<span class="tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span>
<a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his reason kept dinning in his ears, but, in
spite of himself, something else, which seemed
to him unreason, made him anxious. When
he reached Annie Lipton&#39;s home, a fine old
house, overhung with a delicate tracery of
withered vines, he saw Annie&#39;s pretty head
at a front window. She opened the door before
he had time to ring the bell, and she
looked with alarmed questioning at him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have come for Miss Ewing, her uncle—"
James began, but Annie interrupted him, her
face paling perceptibly. "Clemency," she
said; "why, she left here directly after lunch.
She said she must go. She felt anxious about
her mother, and did not want to leave her any
longer. Hasn&#39;t she come home yet?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And you didn&#39;t meet her? You must have
met her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The two stood staring at each other. A delicate
old face peeped out of the door at the
right of the halls. It was like Annie&#39;s, only
dimmed by age, and shaded by two leaf-like
folds of gray hair as smooth as silver. "Oh,
mother, Clemency has not got home!" Annie
cried. "Dr. Elliot, this is my mother.
Mother, Clemency has not got home. What
do you think has happened?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span>
<a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">The lady came out in the hall. She had a
quiet serenity of manner, but her soft eyes
looked anxious. "Could she have stopped
anywhere, dear?" she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You know, mother, there is not a single
house between here and her own where Clemency
ever stops," said Annie. She was trembling
all over.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James made a movement to go. "What
are you going to do?" cried Annie.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Stop at every house between here and
Doctor Gordon&#39;s, and ask if the people have
seen her," replied James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then he ran back to the buggy, and heard
as he went a little nervous call from Annie,
"Oh, let us know if—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I will let you know when I find her, Miss
Lipton," he called back as he gathered up the
lines. He kept his word. He did stop at
every house, and at every one all knowledge
of the girl was disclaimed. There were not
many houses, the road being a lonely one.
He was met mostly by women who seemed at
once to share his anxiety. One woman especially
asked very carefully for a description
of Clemency, and he gave a minute one.
"You say her mother is ill, too," said the
woman. She was elderly, but still pretty.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span>
<a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>She had kept her tints of youth as some
withered flowers do, and there seemed still
to cling to her the atmosphere of youth, as
fragrance clings to dry rose leaves. She was
dressed in rather a superior fashion to most
of the countrywomen, in soft lavender cashmere
which fitted her slight, tall figure admirably.
James had a glimpse behind her of
a pretty interior: a room with windows full
of blooming plants, of easy-chairs and many
cushioned sofas, beside book-cases. The
woman looked, so he thought, like one who
had some private anxiety of her own. She
kept peering up and down the road, as they
talked, as though she, too, were on the watch
for some one. She promised James to keep
a lookout for the missing girl. "Poor little
thing," she murmured. There was something
in her face as she said that, a slight phase of
amusement, which caused James to stare
keenly at her, but it had passed, and her
whole face denoted the utmost candor and
concern.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When James reached home he had a forlorn
hope that he should find Clemency there;
that from a spirit of mischief she had taken
some cross track over the fields to elude him.
But when Aaron met him in the drive, and he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span>
<a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>saw the man&#39;s frightened stare, he knew that
she had not come. It was unnecessary to ask,
but ask he did. "She has not come?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, Doctor Elliot," replied Aaron. He
did not even chew. He tied the horses, and
followed James into the office, with his jaws
stiff. Gordon stood up when James entered,
and looked past him for Clemency. "She
was not there?" he almost shouted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She left the Liptons at two o&#39;clock, and
I have stopped at every house on my way,
and no one has seen her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, my God!" said Gordon, with a dazed
look at James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you think?" asked James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know what to think. I am utterly
at a loss now. I supposed she was entirely
safe. There are almost no tramps at this season,
and in broad daylight. At two, you said?
It is almost six. I don&#39;t know what to do.
What will come next? I must tell Clara something
before I do anything else."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon rushed out of the office, and they
heard his heavy tread on the stairs. Aaron
stared at James, and still he did not chew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s almost dark," he said with a low
drawl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span>
<a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We&#39;ve got to take lanterns, and hunt
along the road and fields."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, we have."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The dog, which had been asleep, got up,
and came over to James, and laid his white
head on his knee. "We can take him,"
Aaron said. "Sometimes dogs have more
sense than us."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That is so," said James. He felt himself
in an agony of helplessness. He simply did
not know what to do. He had sunk into a
chair and his head fairly rung. It seemed to
him incredible that the girl had disappeared
a second time. A queer sense of unreality
made him feel faint.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon reÃ«ntered the room. "I have told
Clara that you have come back, and that
Clemency is to stay all night with Annie Lipton,"
he said. Then he, too, stood staring
helplessly. Emma had come into the room,
and now she spoke angrily to the three dazed
men. "Git the lanterns lit, for goodness&#39;
sake," said she, "and hunt and do something.
I&#39;m goin&#39; to git her supper, and I&#39;ll
keep her pacified." Emma gave a jerk with
a sharp elbow toward Mrs. Ewing&#39;s room.
"For goodness&#39; sake, if you don&#39;t know yet
where she has went, why don&#39;t you do somethin&#39;?"
<span class="tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span>
<a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>she demanded. The men went before
her sharp command like dust before her
broom. "Keep as still as you can," ordered
Emma as they went out. "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">She</span> mustn&#39;t, git
to worryin&#39; before she comes home."</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">
<img src="images/image04.png" width="480" height="686" alt="&quot;Saw a little dark figure running toward him.&quot;" class="tei tei-figure" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">"Saw a little dark figure running toward him." Page 239.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For the next two hours Gordon, James, and
Aaron searched. They walked, each going
his separate way into the fields and woods on
the road, having agreed upon a signal when
the girl should be found. The signal was to
be a pistol shot. James went first to the
wood, where he had found Clemency on her
former disappearance. He searched in every
shadow, throwing the gleam of his lantern
into little dark nests of last year&#39;s ferns, and
hollows where last year&#39;s leaves had swirled
together to die, but no Clemency. At last,
wearied and heart-sick, he came out on the
road. The moon was just up, a full moon, and
the road lay stretched before him like a silver
ribbon covered with the hoar-frost. He gazed
down it hopelessly, and saw a little dark figure
running toward him. He was incredulous,
but he called, "Clemency!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A glad little cry answered him. He himself
ran forward, and the girl was in his arms,
sobbing and trembling as if her heart would
break.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span>
<a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What has happened? What has happened,
darling?" James cried in an agony.
"Are you hurt? What has happened?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Something very strange has happened,
but I am not hurt," sobbed Clemency. James
remembered the signal. "Wait a second,
dear," he said; "your uncle and Aaron are
searching, and I promised to fire the pistol if
I found you." James fired his pistol in the
air six times. Then he returned to Clemency,
who was leaning against a tree. "How I
wish we had driven here!" James said tenderly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can walk, if you help me," Clemency
sobbed, leaning against him. "Oh, I am so
sorry I acted so this morning. I got punished
for it. I haven&#39;t been hurt, nobody has been
anything but kind to me, but I have been
dreadfully frightened."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon and Aaron came running up.
"Where have you been, Clemency?" Gordon
demanded in a harsh voice. "Another
time you must do as you are told. You are
too old to behave like a child, and put us all
in such a fright."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency left James, and ran to her uncle,
and clung to him sobbing hysterically. "Oh,
Uncle Tom, don&#39;t scold me," she whimpered.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span>
<a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Are you hurt? What has happened?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not hurt a bit," sobbed Clemency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon put his arm around her. "Well,"
he said, "as long as you are safe keep your
story until we get home. Elliot, take her other
arm. She is almost too used up to walk.
Now stop crying, Clemency."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When they were home, in the office, Clemency
told her story, which was a strange one.
She had been on her way home from Annie
Lipton&#39;s, and had reached a certain house,
when the door opened and a woman stood
there calling her. She described the woman
and the house, and James gave a start. "That
must be the same woman whom I saw," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She was a woman I had never seen," said
Clemency. "I think she had only lived there
a very short time."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon nodded gloomily. "I know who
she is, I fear," he said. "Strange that I did
not suspect."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She looked very kind and pleasant," said
Clemency, "and I thought she wanted something
and there was no harm, but when I
reached her the first thing I knew she had
hold of me, and her hands were like iron
clamps. She put one over my mouth, and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span>
<a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>held me with the other, and pulled me into the
house and locked the door. Then she made
me go into a little dark room in the middle
of the house and she locked me in. She told
me if I screamed nobody would hear me, but
she did speak kindly. She was very kind.
Once she even kissed me, although I did not
want her to. She brought a lamp in, and
made me lie down on a couch in the room and
drink a glass of wine. She told me not to be
afraid, nobody would hurt me. She seemed
to me to be always listening, and every now
and then she went out, but she always locked
the door behind her. When she came back
she would look terribly worried. About half
an hour ago she went out, and when she came
back brought a tray with tea and bread and
cold chicken for me. I told her I would
starve before I ate anything while she kept
me there. She did not seem to pay much attention,
she looked so dreadfully worried.
She sat down and looked at me. Finally, she
said, as if she were afraid to hear her own
voice, &#39;Has any accident happened near here
lately that you have heard of?&#39; I told her
about the man that fell down in our drive
and died of erysipelas. I did not tell her
anything else. All at once she almost fell in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span>
<a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a faint. Then she stood up, and she looked
as if she were dead. She told me to stay
where I was just fifteen minutes, then I might
go, but I must not stir before. Then she
kissed me again, and her lips were like ice.
She went out, and I knew the door was not
locked, but I was afraid to stir. I could hear
her running about. Then I heard the outer
door slam, and I looked at my watch, and it
was fifteen minutes. Then I ran out and up
the road as fast as I could. Just before I saw
Doctor Elliot the New York train passed. I
heard it. I think she was hurrying to catch
that."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Uncle Tom, who was she, and why
did she lock me up?" asked Clemency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency," said Gordon, in a sterner
voice than Clemency had ever heard him use
toward her, "never speak, never think, of that
woman or that man again. Now go out and
eat your dinner."</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER XII</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency was so worn out that Doctor Gordon
insisted upon her going to bed directly
after dinner, and he and James had a solitary
evening in the office, with the exception
of Gordon&#39;s frequent absence in his wife&#39;s
room. Each time when he returned he looked
more gloomy. "I have increased the morphine
almost as much as I dare," he said,
coming into the office about ten. He sat down
and lit his pipe. James laid down the evening
paper which he had been reading. "Is she
asleep now?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes. By the way, Elliot, have you guessed
who that woman was who kidnapped Clemency?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James hesitated. "I don&#39;t fairly know
whether I am right, but I have guessed," he
replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The nurse."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are right. It was the nurse. That
man had won her over, and set her up housekeeping
in Westover. He had been staying
<span class="tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span>
<a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at the hotel there before he came here. He
was her lover, of course, although he was too
circumspect not to guard the secret. She has
been living in that house for the last three
months under the name of Mrs. Wood, a
widow. The former occupants went away
last summer, Aaron has been telling me. He
said that once he himself saw the man enter
the house, and he had seen the woman on the
street. She had made herself quite popular
in Westover. It was no part of that man&#39;s
policy to keep his vice behind locked doors.
Locks themselves are the best witness against
evil. She attended the Dutch Reformed
Church regularly. She was present at all
the church suppers, and everybody has called
on her in Westover. Now I think she has
fled, half-crazed with grief over the death of
her lover, and afraid of some sort of exposure.
Unless I miss my guess, there will be
a furor around here shortly over her disappearance.
She was not a bad woman as I
remember her, and she was attractive, with
a kindly disposition. But he had his way always
with women, and I suppose she thought
she was doing him a service by kidnapping
poor little Clemency. I am sorry for her.
I hope she did not go away penniless, but she
<span class="tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span>
<a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has her nursing to fall back upon. She was
a good nurse. That makes me think. I must
see if Mrs. Blair cannot come here to-morrow.
Clara must have somebody beside Clemency
and Emma. I should prefer a trained nurse,
and this woman is simply the self-taught village
sort, but Clara prefers her. She shrinks
at the very mention of a trained nurse. Of
course, it is unreasonable, but the poor soul
has always had an awful dread of hospitals
and a possible operation, and I believe that
in some way she thinks a trained nurse one
of a dreadful trinity. She must be humored,
of course. The result cannot be changed."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You have no hope, then?" James said in
a low voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have had no more from the outset than
if she had been already dead," said Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James said nothing. An enormous pity for
the other man was within him. He thought
of Clemency, and he seemed to undergo the
same pangs. He felt such a terrible understanding
of the other&#39;s suffering that it passed
the bounds of sympathy. It became almost
experience. His young face took on the same
expression of dull misery as Gordon&#39;s. Presently
Gordon glanced at him, and spoke with
a ring of gratitude and affection in his tired
voice.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span>
<a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are a good fellow, Elliot," he said,
"and you are the one ray of comfort I have.
I am glad that I have you to leave poor little
Clemency with."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James looked at him with sudden alarm.
"You are not ill?" he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, but there is an end to everybody&#39;s
rope, and sometimes I think I am about at
the end of mine. I don&#39;t know. Anyway, it
is a comfort to me to think that Clemency
has you in case anything should happen to
me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She has me as long as I live," James said
fervently. Red overspread his young face,
his eyes glistened. Again the great pity and
understanding with regard to the other man
came over him, and a feeling for Clemency
which he had never before had: a feeling
greater than love itself, the very angel of
love, divinest pity and protection, for all
womanhood, which was exemplified for himself
in this one girl. His heart ached, as if
it were Clemency&#39;s upstairs, lying miserably
asleep under the influence of the drug, which
alone could protect her from indescribable
pain. His mind projected itself into the future,
and realized the possibility of such suffering
for her, and for himself. The honey-sting
<span class="tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span>
<a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of pain, which love has, stung him
sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon seemed to divine his thoughts.
"God grant that you may never have to
undergo what I am undergoing, boy," he
said. Then he added, "It was in poor Clara&#39;s
blood, her mother before her died the same
way. Clemency comes, on her mother&#39;s side
at least, of a healthy race, morally and physically,
although the nervous system is oversensitive.
If my poor sister had been happy,
she would have been alive to-day. And as
far as I know of the other side, there was
perfect physical health, although he had that
abnormal lack of moral sense that led one to
dream of possession. Did you notice how
much less evil he looked when he was dead,
even with that frightfully disfigured face?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There are strange things in this world,"
said Gordon with gloomy reflection, "or else
simple things which we are strange not to believe.
Sometimes I think people will have to
take to the Bible again in that literal sense
in which so many are now inclined to disregard
it. Well, Elliot, I honestly feel that you
have nothing to fear in taking poor little
Clemency. I should tell you if I thought
<span class="tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span>
<a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>otherwise. She will make you happy, and I
can think of no reason to warn you concerning
any possible lapses, in either her physical
or her moral health, and I have had her in
my charge since she first drew the breath of
life. Come, my son, it is late, and we have a
great deal to do to-morrow. This awful business
has made me neglect patients. I have
to see Clara again, and get what rest I can."
Gordon looked older and wearier than James
had ever seen him, as he bade him good-night,
old and weary as he had often seen him look.
A sudden alarm for Gordon himself came
over him. He wondered, after he had entered,
his room, if he were not strained past endurance.
He recalled his own father&#39;s healthy,
ruddy face, and Gordon was no older.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He lay awake a while thinking anxiously
of Gordon, then his own happy future blazoned
itself before him, and he dreamed
awake, and dreamed asleep, of himself and
Clemency, in that future, whose golden vistas
had no end, so far as his young eyes
could see. The sense of relief from anxiety
over the girl was so intense that it was in
itself a delight. Clemency herself felt it.
The next morning at breakfast she looked
radiant. Gordon had assured her the sick
<span class="tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span>
<a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>woman had rested quietly, and told her that
Mrs. Blair was coming.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"To-day I can go where I choose," Clemency
exclaimed gayly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not until afternoon," replied Gordon, then
he relented at her look of disappointment,
and suggested that she go with Elliot to make
his calls, while he went with Aaron and the
team. It was a beautiful morning; spring
seemed to have arrived. Everywhere was the
plash of running water, now and then came
distant flutings of birds. "I know that was
a bluebird," Clemency said happily. "I feel
sure mother will get well now. It seems
wicked to be glad that the man is dead, especially
on such a morning, but I wonder if it
is, when he would have spoiled the morning."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t think about it, anyway!" James
said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I try not to."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must not!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know why Uncle Tom did not want me
to go out alone this morning," Clemency said,
with one of her quick wise looks, cocking her
head like a bird.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He wanted to make sure that that woman
has really gone."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span>
<a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency, you must not mention that
man or woman to me again," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not married to you yet," Clemency
said, pouting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That makes no difference, you must
promise."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, then, I will. I am so happy this
morning, that I will promise anything."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James looked about to be sure nobody was
in sight before he kissed the little radiant
face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I won&#39;t speak of them again, but I am
right," Clemency said with a little toss and
blush, and it proved that she was.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At luncheon Doctor Gordon told Clemency
that she could go wherever she liked. She
gave a little glance at James, and said gayly,
"All right, Uncle Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That afternoon Gordon and James made
some calls in company, driving far into the
hills. They had hardly started before Gordon
said abruptly, "Well, the woman is gone,
and there is a wild excitement in Westover
over her disappearance. I believe they are
about to drag the pond. A man who knew
her well by sight declares that she boarded
that New York train, but the people will not
give up the theory that she has been murdered
<span class="tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span>
<a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for her jewelry. By the way, I think
I need not worry over her immediate necessities.
It seems that she had worn a quantity
of very valuable jewels. Of course her going
without any baggage except a suit-case, and
leaving behind the greater part of her wardrobe,
does look singular. But it seems that
the house was rented furnished, and I fancy
she lived always in light marching orders,
and probably carried the most valuable of her
possessions upon her person and in her suit-case.
Well, I am thankful she has decamped."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You don&#39;t fear her returning?" asked
James with some anxiety.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I have no fear of that. She is probably
broken-hearted over the death of that
man. She is not of the sort to kidnap on her
own account. It was only for him. Clemency
has nothing more to fear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am thankful."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You can well believe that I am, when I
tell you that this afternoon I am absolutely
sure, for the first time in years, that the girl
is safe to come and go as she pleases. I have
had hideous uncertainty as well as hideous
certainty to cope with. Now it is down to the
hideous certainty. That is bad enough, but
fate on an open field is less unmanning than
<span class="tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span>
<a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fate in ambush. I have long known to a
nicety the fate in the field." Gordon hesitated
a second, then he said abruptly, with
his face turned from his companion, in a
rough voice, "Clara can&#39;t last many days."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James made an exclamation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She has gone down hill rapidly during
the last two days," said Gordon. "I have
been increasing the morphine. It can&#39;t last
long." Gordon ended the sentence with a
hoarse sob.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t say anything," James faltered
after a second, "but you know—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I know," Gordon said. "You are
as sorry as any one can be who is not, so to
speak, the hero, or rather the coward, of the
tragedy. Yes, I know. I&#39;m obliged to you,
Elliot, but all of us have to face death,
whether it is our own or the death of another
dearer than ourselves, alone. A soul is a horribly
lonely thing in the worst places of life."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Have you told Clemency?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I have put it off until the last minute.
What good can it do? She knows that Clara
is very ill, but she does not know, she has
never known, the character of the illness.
Sometimes I have a curious feeling that instinct
has asserted itself, and that Clemency,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span>
<a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fond as she is of my wife, has not exactly the
affection which she would have had for her
own mother."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t think she knows any difference
at all," James said. "I think the poor little
girl will about break her heart."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I did not mean to underestimate Clemency&#39;s
affection," said Gordon, "but what I
say is true. The girl herself will never know
it, and, you may not believe it, but she will
not suffer as she would suffer if Clara were
her own mother. These ties of the blood are
queer things, nothing can quite take their
place. If Clemency had died first Clara would
have been indignant at the suggestion, but
she herself would not have mourned as she
would mourn for her own daughter. I must
touch up the horses a bit. I want to get home.
I may not be able to go out again to-night.
Last night I was up until dawn with Clara."
Gordon touched the horses with a slight flicker
of the whip. He held the lines taut as they
sprang forward. His face was set ahead.
James glancing at him had a realization of
the awful loneliness of the other man by his
side. He seemed to comprehend the vastness
of the isolation of a grief which concerns one,
and one only, more than any other. Gordon
<span class="tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span>
<a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had the expression of a wanderer upon a desert
or a frozen waste. Illimitable distances
of solitude seemed reflected in his gloomy
eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James did not attempt to talk to him. It
seemed like mockery, this effort to approach
with sympathy this set-apart man, who was
unapproachable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That night Gordon&#39;s wife was much worse.
Gordon came down to James&#39;s room about
two o&#39;clock. James had been awake for some
time listening to the sounds of suffering overhead,
and he had lit his lamp and dressed,
thinking that he might be needed. Gordon
stood in the doorway almost reeling. He
made an effort before he spoke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Come into my office, will you?" he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James at once followed him. Going through
the hall the sounds of agony became more distinct.
When they entered the office Gordon
fairly slammed the door, then he turned to
Elliot with a savage expression. "Hear
that," he said, as if he were accusing the
other man. "Hear that, I say! The last
hypodermic has not taken effect yet, and her
heart is weak. If I give her more—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He stopped, staring at James, his face
worked like a child&#39;s. Then suddenly an almost
<span class="tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span>
<a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>idiotic expression came over it, the utter
numbness of grief. Then it passed away.
Again he looked intelligently into the young
man&#39;s eyes. "If I don&#39;t give her more," he
gasped out, "if I don&#39;t, this may last hours.
If I do—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The two men stood staring at each other.
James thought of Clemency. "Has Clemency
been in to see her?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, she heard, and came in. I sent her
out. She is in her own room now; Emma is
with her." Suddenly Gordon gave a look of
despairing appeal at James. "I—wish you
would go up and see Clara," he whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James knew what he meant. He hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Go, and send Mrs. Blair down here,"
said Gordon. "Tell her I want to see her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well," said James slowly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The two men did not look at each other
again. Gordon sank into his chair. James
went out of the room and upstairs. He
knocked on the door of the sick-room, and
Mrs. Blair, the village nurse, answered his
knock. She was a large woman in a voluminous
wrapper. Her face had a settled expression
of gravity, almost of sternness. She
looked at James. The screams from the writhing
mass of agony in the bed did not appear
<span class="tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span>
<a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to be moving her, whereas she in reality was
herself screwed to such a pitch of mental torture
of pity that she was scarcely able to move.
She was rigid.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctor Gordon sent me," whispered
James. "He wished me to see her. He asked
me to say to you that he would like to see you
for a minute in the office."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The woman did not move for a second.
Then she whispered close to James&#39;s ear, "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">It
is on the bureau</span>."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James nodded. They passed each other.
James entered the room and closed the door.
A lamp was burning on a table with a screen
before it. The bed was in shadow. The
screams never ceased. They were not human.
James could not realize that the beautiful
woman whom he had known was making such
sounds. They sounded like the shrieks of an
animal. All the soul seemed gone from them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James approached the bed. There was a
roll of dark eyes at him. Then a voice ghastly
beyond description, like the snarl of a hungry
beast, came from between the straight white
lips. "More, more! Give me more! Be
quick!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Quick, quick!" demanded the voice.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span>
<a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">James crossed the room to the dresser.
The sick woman now interspersed her screams
with the word "quick!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James filled a hypodermic syringe from a
glass on the bureau and approached the bed
again. He bared a shuddering arm and inserted
the instrument quickly. "Now try
and be quiet," he said. "You will go to
sleep."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then he went out of the room. The screams
had ceased. As James approached the stair
another door opened, and Clemency in a
wrapper looked out. She was very pale, her
eyes were distended with fear, and her mouth
was trembling. "How is she?" she whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Better, dear. Go back in your room and
lie down. We are doing all we can."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When James entered the office Gordon and
Mrs. Blair turned with one accord, and fixed
horribly searching eyes upon his face. He
sat down beside the table, and mechanically
lit a cigar.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How did she seem?" Gordon asked almost
inaudibly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Better."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was she quiet?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span>
<a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon gave a long sigh. His face was
deadly white. He leaned back in his chair,
and both James and the nurse sprang. They
thought he had fainted. While James felt
his pulse Mrs. Blair got some brandy. Gordon
swallowed the brandy, and raised his
head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is nothing," he said in a harsh voice.
"You had better go back to her, Mrs. Blair."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A look of strange dread came over the woman&#39;s
grave face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I will be there directly," said Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Blair went out. She left the door
ajar. The house was so still that one could
seem to hear the silence. There was something
terrible about it after the turmoil of
sound. Then the silence was broken. A
scream more terrible than ever pierced it like
a sword. Another came. Gordon sprang up
and faced James. The young man&#39;s eyes fell
before the look of fierce questioning in Gordon&#39;s.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I could not," he gasped. "Oh, Doctor
Gordon, I could not! Instead of that I
used water. I thought perhaps her mind
being convinced that it was morphine, she
might—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mind!" shouted Gordon. "Mind, how
<span class="tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span>
<a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>much do you suppose the poor, tortured thing
has to bring to bear upon this? I tell you she
is being eaten alive. There is no other word
for it. Gnawed, and worried, and eaten
alive." Gordon ran out of the room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James closed the door. The dog, who had
been asleep beside the fire, started up, came
over to James, laid his white head on his knee
and whimpered, with an appealing look in his
brown eyes, which were turned toward the
young man&#39;s face. Almost immediately Mrs.
Blair entered the room. She was very pale.
"Doctor Gordon sent me down for the
brandy," she said abruptly. She went to the
table on which the brandy flask stood, but she
seemed in no hurry to take it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How is she?" asked James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think she is a little quieter." The nurse
stood staring at the fire for a second longer.
Then she took the brandy flask and went out
with a soft, but jarring, tread.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Doctor Gordon must have passed her on the
stairs, for he returned almost directly after
she had left, and stood with his back to James,
fussing over some bottles on the shelves opposite
the fireplace. He stood there for some
five minutes. James glancing over his shoulder
saw that he was trembling in a strange
<span class="tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span>
<a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rigid fashion, but he seemed intent upon the
bottles. The house was very still again. Gordon
at last seemed to have finished whatever
he was doing with the bottles. He left them
and sat down in his chair. The dog left James
and went to him, but Gordon pushed him
away roughly. Then Gordon spoke to James
without turning his face in his direction. "I
wish you would go upstairs," he said hoarsely.
"Mrs. Blair is alone, and I—I am about done
too."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James obeyed without a word. When he
reached the head of the stairs he felt a sudden
draught of cold wind. Mrs. Blair came
out of the sick-room, closing the door behind
her. Her face looked as stern as fate itself.
James knew what had happened the moment
he saw her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James began to speak stammeringly, but
she stopped him. "Call Doctor Gordon," she
said shortly. "She is dead."</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER XIII</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">About two weeks after the death of Doctor
Gordon&#39;s wife James went to the post office
before beginning his round of calls. Lately
nearly all the practice had devolved upon
him. Gordon seemed sunken in a gloomy
apathy, from which he could rouse himself
only for the most urgent necessities. Once
aroused he was fully himself, but for the most
part he sat in his office smoking or seemingly
half-asleep. Once in a while a very sick patient
acted upon him as a momentary stimulus,
but Alton was unusually healthy just
then. After an open and, for the most part,
snowless winter, which had occasioned much
sickness, the spring brought frost and light
falls of snow, which seemed to give new life
to people in spite of unseasonableness. James
had had little difficulty in attending to most
of the practice, although he was necessarily
away from home the greater part of the time.
However, he often took Clemency with him,
and she would sit well wrapped up in the
buggy reading a book while he made calls.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span>
<a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then there were the long drives over solitary
roads, which, though rough, causing the
wheels to jolt heavily in deep ridges of frozen
soil, or sink into the red mud almost to the
hubs, as the case might be, seemed like roads
of Paradise to the young man. Although he
himself grieved for Gordon&#39;s wife, and Gordon
himself filled him with covert anxiety, yet he
was young and the girl was young, and they
were both released from a miserable sense of
insecurity and mystery, which had irritated
and saddened them; their thoughts now turned
toward their own springtime, as naturally
and innocently as flowers bloom. There was
grief, and the shadow of trouble, but of past
trouble; their eyes looked upon life and love
and joy instead of death, as helplessly as a
flower looks toward the sun. They were
happy, although half-ashamed of their happiness;
but, after all, perhaps, being happy
after bereavement and trouble means simply
that the soul has turned to God for consolation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James&#39;s face was beaming with his joyful
thoughts as he drew up before the village
store, got out of the buggy, and tied the horse.
When he entered he said "good morning!" in
a sort of general fashion. There were many
<span class="tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span>
<a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>men lounging about. The morning mail had
been distributed, and although Alton people
got very few letters, still there was a wide
interest in the post office, a little boxed-off
space in a corner of the store. The store-keeper,
Henry Graves, was the postmaster.
He felt the importance of his position. When
he sorted and distributed the mail from the
limp leather bag, he realized himself as an
official of a great republic. He loved to
proudly ignore, and not even seem to see, the
interested and gaping faces watching the
boxes. Doctor Gordon&#39;s box was an object
of especial interest. Indeed, that was the
only one to be depended upon to contain
something when the two mails per day arrived.
Gordon, moreover, took the only New
York paper which reached the little hamlet.
Alton had no paper of its own. The nearest
was printed in Stanbridge. One man, the
Presbyterian minister, subscribed to the Stanbridge
paper, and paid for it in farm produce.
He had a little farm, and tilled the
soil when he was not saving souls. The Stanbridge
paper had arrived the night before,
and the minister had been good enough to
impart some of its contents to the curious
throng in the store. He was accustomed to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span>
<a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>do so. Likewise Gordon, when he was not too
hurried, would open his New York paper,
and read the most startling "headers" to a
wide-eyed audience. This morning the paper
was in the box as usual, with a number of
letters. The men pressed in a suggestive
way around James, as he took the parcel
from the postmaster. There were no lock-boxes.
James hesitated a moment. He had
not much time, but he was good-natured, and
the eager hunger in the men&#39;s eyes appealed
to him. There was something pathetic about
this outreaching for intelligence of their kind,
and its progress or otherwise, among these
plodding folk, who had so to count their
pence that a newspaper was an unheard-of
luxury to them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James opened the paper and glanced over
the headlines on the first page. Now, had he
looked, he might have seen something sinister
and malicious in the curious eyes, but he
was so dazed by the very first thing he saw
as to be for the moment oblivious to anything
else. On the right of the first page was the
headline: "Strange dual life of a prominent
physician in Alton, New Jersey. Doctor
Thomas B. Gordon has lived with his wife
for years, and called her his widowed sister,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span>
<a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Mrs. Clara Ewing. Upon her death, a few
days since, he revealed the secret. Will give
no reasons for this strange conduct, simply
states that he was justified, even compelled,
by circumstances." Then followed a caricature
portrait of Gordon, a photograph of
the house, one of the village church, and the
cemetery and Gordon&#39;s wife&#39;s grave, with
various surmises and comments, enough to
fill the column. James paled as he read. He
had not known of Gordon&#39;s action in telling
that the dead woman was his wife. He looked
around in a bewildered fashion, and met the
hungry eyes. One small, mean face of a
small man peered around his shoulder gloatingly.
"Some news this mornin&#39;?" he observed,
with a smack of the lips, as if he tasted
sweets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then James arose to the occasion. He
faced them all and smiled coolly. "Yes,"
he replied; "you mean about Doctor Gordon?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was a murmur of assent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James read the article from beginning to
end. "I suppose it is news to you," he said,
when he had finished. He looked at them all
with a superior air. He looked older and
more manly than when he had first come in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span>
<a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their midst. He <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">was</span> older and more manly,
and he was superior. The men recognized it,
not sullenly nor defiantly, but with the unquestioning
attitude of the New Jerseyman
when he is really below the scale in birth and
education. Still their faces all expressed
malicious cunning and cruel curiosity, which
they hesitated to put into words. They knew
that Elliot was to marry Gordon&#39;s niece; they
were overawed by both men, but they were
afraid of Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Still Jim Goodman found courage of his
meanness and smallness and spoke. "It
seems a strange thing," he said, "that Doctor
Gordon should hev came and went here
for years, and all of us thinkin&#39; his wife were
his sister when she were not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, what of it?" asked James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The men stared at one another.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What of it?" repeated James. "I don&#39;t
suppose there is anything criminal in a man&#39;s
calling his wife by his sister&#39;s name. Doctor
Gordon has a sister named Ewing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again the men stared at one another, and
Jim Goodman was the only one who had the
miserable courage to speak. "S&#39;pose him
an&#39; her were married," he said, in a thin voice
like the squeal of a fox.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span>
<a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Which of you wants to be knocked down
can make a statement to the contrary,"
thundered James. "Is that what you make
of it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Goodman shuffled from one foot to the
other. Men nudged shoulders, Goodman
spoke. "Nobody never knows what is true
or ain&#39;t true in them newspapers," he observed,
and there was a note of alarm in his
voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I did not read a thing in the whole column
which even implied such a thing as you
intimated," James said hotly. "Don&#39;t put
it off on the newspapers!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then another man spoke, a farmer, tall,
dry, lank, and impervious. He was a man
about whom were ill-reports. His wife had
died some years before, and he had a housekeeper,
a florid, blonde creature, dressed with
dingy showiness, of whom people spoke with
covert laughs. "All we want to know is why
Doctor Gordon has never said that her was
his wife, and not his sister," he said in a defiant
nasal voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The malignant Jim Goodman saw his
chance. He jumped upon it like a spider.
"That&#39;s so," he said. "Why didn&#39;t he say
she was his housekeeper?" There was a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span>
<a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shout of coarse laughter. The farmer gave a
hateful look at Goodman and puffed at a rank
pipe.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James was furious, but he saw the necessity
of a statement of some kind, and his wits
leaped to action. "Well," he said, "suppose
there was a question of money."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The crowd pressed closer and gaped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Money!" said Goodman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, money," pursued James recklessly.
"Did you never hear of people being opposed
to marriages, rich people I mean, and
threatening to disinherit a woman if she married
the man they did not pick out for her?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was that it?" asked Goodman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not saying that it was or was not.
I am not going to discuss Doctor Gordon&#39;s
secrets with you. It&#39;s none of your business,
and none of my business. All I am saying
is this, suppose there had been a girl years
ago with a very rich bachelor brother. Suppose
the brother had been jilted by a girl,
and hated the whole lot of women like poison,
and had no idea of getting married himself,
and his sister would be his only heiress, and
he had set his foot down that she should not
marry Doc—the man she had set her heart
upon. Suppose he went to—well, the South
<span class="tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span>
<a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Sea Islands, for the rest of his life, to get out
of sight and sound of women like the one who
had jilted him, told his sister before he went
that if she married the man she wanted he
would make a will and leave his money away
from her, build an hospital or a library or
something, suppose she hit upon the plan of
marrying the man she wanted, and keeping it
quiet."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was that it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Didn&#39;t I tell you that I would not say
whether it was or not? I only say suppose
that was the case. Doctor Gordon has a
married sister by the name of Ewing living
in foreign parts. You can see for yourself
how easy it might have been."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What about the girl?" asked Goodman
in a dry voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James flushed angrily. "That is nobody&#39;s
business," said he. "She is Doctor Gordon&#39;s
niece."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Goodman was unabashed. "How does it
happen her name is Ewing?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Couldn&#39;t it possibly have happened that
two sisters of Doctor Gordon&#39;s married two
brothers?" James cried. He elbowed his
way out. When he was in the buggy driving
home, he began to realize how the fairy tale
<span class="tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span>
<a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which he had related in the store would not
in the least impose upon Clemency, how she
would almost inevitably hear of the statements
in the papers. He wondered more and
more that Gordon should have divulged a
secret which he had kept so fiercely for so
long.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When he reached home he went at once
into the office, and gave Gordon his mail and
the New York paper. Gordon glanced at it,
then at James. "Have you seen this?" he
asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose you think me most inconsistent,"
said Gordon gloomily, "but the truth
is I kept the secret while Clara was alive,
though I found I could not, oh, God, I could
not after she was dead and gone! I had not
realized what that would mean: to never
acknowledge her as my wife, dead or alive.
I found that when it came to the death certificate,
and the notice in the paper, and the
erection of a stone to her memory, that I
could not keep up the deception, no matter
what the consequence. My God, Elliot, I
cannot commit sacrilege against the dead!
Dead, she must have her due. I anticipated
this. There was something last night in the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span>
<a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Stanbridge Record</span>, and yesterday, while you
were out three reporters from New York
came. I told them that I had done what I
had for good and sufficient reasons, which
were not dishonorable to myself or to others,
and beyond that I would say nothing. I suppose
the poor fellows had to tax their imaginations
to fill their columns. I don&#39;t know
what the result will be with regard to Clemency,
but I could not help it." There was
something painfully appealing in Gordon&#39;s
look and manner. He seemed so broken that
James was alarmed. He said everything that
he was able to say to soothe him, commended
the course which he had taken, and told him
what he had said at the store, without repeating
the insinuations which had led him
to fabricate such a tale. Gordon smiled bitterly.
"All your fellowmen want of you is
food for their animal appetites or their mental,"
he said. "They must have meat and
drink for their stomachs, as well as for their
curiosity and malice. I have lived here all
these years, and labored for them for mighty
poor recompense, and sometimes for none at
all, and I&#39;ll warrant that to-day I am more in
their minds than I have ever been before, because
they have found out my secret, which
<span class="tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span>
<a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has been the torture of my life. I wonder if
Clemency has heard anything about it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I will go and see," replied James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The minute he saw Clemency, who was in
the parlor, he knew that she knew. By her
side on the floor was the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Stanbridge Record</span>.
She looked at James and pointed to it without
a word. Her face was white as death.
James took up the paper. That merely announced
the fact of Mrs. Gordon&#39;s death,
dwelt upon her many beautiful qualities of
mind and body, her great suffering, and stated
briefly the astonishment with which the news
was received that she was Doctor Gordon&#39;s
wife, and not his sister, as people had been
led to suppose. "Little Annie Codman just
brought it over," said Clemency. "She said
her mother sent it. It is just like her mother.
Mr. Codman never would have done such a
thing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Codman was the minister.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James, for a second, did not know what to
say. He thought of the absurd story which he
had told, or rather suggested, at the store, and
realized that such a fabrication would not answer
here.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Immediately Clemency fired a point-blank
question at him. "Who am I?" she asked.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span>
<a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are Doctor Gordon&#39;s niece, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But—she was not my mother."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who am I?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are the daughter of Doctor Gordon&#39;s
youngest sister, who died when you
were born."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency sat reflecting, her forehead knit,
a keen look in her blue eyes. "I knew my
father was dead," she said after a little.
"Uncle Tom has always told me that he
passed away three months before I was born,
but—" She raised a puzzled, shocked,
grieved face to James. "What is my name?"
she asked. "My real name?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James hesitated. Then his mind reverted to
the tale which he had told at the store. He
could see no other way out of the difficulty.
"Did you never hear of two brothers marrying
two sisters, dear?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency gazed at him with a puzzled, almost
suspicious, look. "I knew I had an
aunt and cousin in England named Ewing,"
she said, "but I always supposed that my
English aunt was not my real aunt, only my
aunt by marriage, that she had married my
father&#39;s brother."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Your English aunt is your uncle&#39;s own
sister," said James.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span>
<a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I see: my own mother and my aunt were
sisters, and they married brothers," Clemency
said slowly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That is unusual, but not unprecedented,"
said James. He had never been involved in
such a web of fabrication. He felt his cheeks
burning. He was sure that he looked guilty,
but Clemency did not seem to notice it. She
was reflecting, still with that puzzled knitting
of her forehead and that introspective look
in her blue eyes. "I wonder if I look in the
least like my own mother?" she said in a curious
voice, as of one who feels her way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Once your uncle said to me that you were
your own mother&#39;s very image," replied James
eagerly. He was glad to have the chance to
say anything truthful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency&#39;s face lightened. She spoke with
that fatuous innocence and romance of young
girls, and often of older women, to whom romance
and sentiment are in the place of reason.
"Then I know who that man was," she
announced in a delighted voice. "You and
Uncle Tom thought I would never know, but
I do know. I have found out my own self."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who was he, dear?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, I don&#39;t know who he was really, and
I don&#39;t know who that woman was. She
<span class="tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span>
<a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>does mix up things a good deal, but this much
I do know—why Uncle Tom passed off my
aunt for my mother, and why we were always
hiding from that man. He was in love
with my mother, and he was in love with me,
because I am so much like her. Now, tell me
honest, dear, didn&#39;t Uncle Tom ever tell you
that that man was in love with my mother
before I was born?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, dear," James answered, fairly bewildered
over the fashion in which truth was
lending itself to the need of falsehood.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency nodded her head triumphantly.
"There, I told you I knew," said she. "Poor
man, it was dreadful of him to pursue me so,
and make us all so unhappy, and of course
I never could have married him, even if it
had not been for you. I do think he looked
like a wicked man, and of course I never
could have endured the thought of marrying
a man who had been in love with my mother,
even if he had been ever so good. But I can&#39;t
help being sorry for him; he must have loved
my mother so much, and he must have wasted
his whole life; and then to die among strangers
so suddenly, poor man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt a sort of pleasure at hearing
the girl express, all unknowingly, sympathy
<span class="tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span>
<a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for her dead father. The tears actually
stood in her eyes. "The queerest thing to
me is that woman," she added musingly, after
a minute. Then again her face lightened.
"Why, I do believe she was his sister," she
cried, "and that was the reason she wanted
to get me, and the reason why she was so
dreadfully upset when she heard he was dead,
poor thing. Well, of course, I can&#39;t help
feeling glad that I am not in danger any
more; but I am sorry for that poor man, even
if he wasn&#39;t good." A tear rolled visibly
down Clemency&#39;s cheeks. Then she got out
her handkerchief and sobbed violently. "Oh,
I haven&#39;t realized," she moaned, "I haven&#39;t
realized until this minute, how terrible it is
that she wasn&#39;t my mother."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She was as good as a mother to you,
dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I know, but she wasn&#39;t, and it hurts
me worse now she is gone than it would have
done when she was alive. I don&#39;t seem to have
anything."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You have me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then Clemency ran to him, and he held her
on his knee and comforted her, then tore
himself away to make his morning round of
calls. Clemency followed him to the door,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span>
<a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and kissed her hand to him as he drove away.
James had good reason to remember it, for
it was the last loving salutation from her for
many a day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When he returned at noon the girl&#39;s manner
was unaccountably changed toward him.
She only spoke to him directly when addressed,
and then in monosyllables. She never
looked at him. She sat at the table at luncheon
and poured the chocolate, and there was
almost absolute silence. Emma waited jerkily
as usual. James fancied once, when he met
her eyes, that there was an expression of
covert triumph on her face. Emma had never
liked him. He had been conscious of the
fact, but it had not disturbed him. He had
no more thought of this middle-aged, harsh-featured
New Jersey farmer&#39;s daughter than
he had of one of the dining-chairs. Gordon
sat humped upon himself, as he sat nowadays,
a marked stoop of age was becoming
visible in his broad shoulders, and he ate
perfunctorily without a word. James, after
a number of futile attempts to talk to Clemency,
subsided himself into bewildered silence,
and ate with very little appetite. There were
chops and potatoes and peas, and apple-pie,
for luncheon. When it came to the pie Emma
<span class="tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span>
<a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>served Clemency and Doctor Gordon, and deliberately
omitted James. Nobody seemed
to notice it, although James felt sure that
the omission was intentional. He felt himself
inwardly amused at the antagonism
which could take such a form, and went
without his pie uncomplainingly, while Gordon
and Clemency ate theirs. The dog at
this juncture came slinking into the room
and close to James, who gave him a lump of
sugar from the bowl which happened to stand
near him. At once Emma took the bowl and
moved it to another part of the table out of
his reach. James felt a strong inclination to
laugh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The dog sat up and begged for more sugar,
and James, when they all left the table, coolly
took a handful of sugar from the bowl and carried
it into the office, the dog leaping at his
side. Emma slammed the dining-room door
behind him. Clemency, without a look at
him, immediately ran upstairs to her own
room. Gordon and James sat down in the
office as usual for a smoke until James should
start upon his afternoon rounds. Gordon
asked him a few questions about the patients
whom he had seen that morning, but in a
listless, abstracted fashion, then he spoke of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span>
<a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>those whom James would see that afternoon.
"You had better take the team," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency is going with me," James said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon looked at him with faint surprise.
"I think you must be mistaken," he said.
"Clemency came to me just before luncheon
and asked if I had any objections to her
spending a few days with Annie Lipton. I
told her we could get on perfectly well without
her, and Aaron is going to drive her over.
She will have to take a suit-case. I knew
you had to go in another direction, and could
not take her. I thought the change would do
her good. Didn&#39;t she say anything to you
about it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think it will do her good. She needs a
little change," James replied evasively. As
he spoke Aaron came out of the stable leading
the bay mare harnessed to a buggy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She is going right away," said Gordon,
looking a little puzzled. He had hardly finished
speaking before Clemency&#39;s voice was
heard in the hall. It rang rather hard, but
quite clearly. "Good-by," she called out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Good-by," responded Gordon and James
together. Gordon looked at James, astonished
that he did not go out to assist Clemency into
the buggy, and bid her good-by. He seemed
<span class="tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span>
<a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>about to question him, then he took another
puff at his pipe, and his face settled into its
wonted expression of gloomy retrospection.
Boy&#39;s and girl&#39;s love affairs seemed as motes
in a beam of sunlight to him at this juncture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James started to go, the horses were stamping
uneasily in the drive, and he had a long
round of calls to make that afternoon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon removed his pipe. "I am putting a
good deal on you, Elliot," he said with a kind
of hard sadness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s all right," James replied cheerfully,
"I am strong. I can stand it if the
patients can. I fancied old Mrs. Steen was
rather disgusted to see me this morning. I
heard her say something about sendin&#39; a boy
to her daughter, and when I went into the bedroom,
she glared at me, and said, &#39;You?&#39;"
James laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Her case is not at all desperate," Gordon
said gloomily. "She is merely on the
downward road of life. Nothing ails her
except that. You can supply the few inadequate
crutches of tonics as well as any one.
There is not one desperately sick patient on
the whole list now, that I know of, although
I must confess that that Willoughby girl
rather puzzles me. She breaks every diagnosis
all to pieces."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span>
<a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hysteria," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, yes, I know hysteria is a good way
to account for our own lack of insight," said
Gordon, "and it may be that girls are queer
subjects. Sometimes I wonder if they know
what they know. Lilian Willoughby does
not."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon, to James&#39;s intense surprise, flared
into a burst of anger. "Yes, she does know,"
he declared. "Down in her inner consciousness
I believe she does, poor little overstrung,
oversensitive girl, half-fed, as to her body,
on coarse food which she cannot assimilate,
starved emotionally. If a girl like that has
to exist anyway, why cannot she be born under
different circumstances? That girl as daughter
of a New Jersey farmer is an anomaly.
If she mates at all it must be with another
New Jersey farmer, then she dies after bringing
a few degenerates into the world. Providence
does things like that, and the doctors
are supposed to right things. That girl has
had symptoms of about every known disease,
and my diagnosis has failed to prove the existence
of one of them. Yet there are the
symptoms. Call it hysteria, or what you will.
I call it an injustice on the part of the Higher
Power. I suppose that is blasphemy, but I
<span class="tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span>
<a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>am forced to it. Can that girl help the longings
for her rights, her longings which are
abnormally acute because of her over-fine
nervous system? Those longings, situated as
she is, can never be satisfied in any way except
for her own harm. Meantime she eats
her own heart, since she has nothing else,
and heart-eating produces all kinds of symptoms.
I am absolutely powerless in such a
case, though sometimes I make a diagnosis
which I think may be correct, sometimes I
think there is some organic trouble which I
can mitigate. But always I fall back upon
the miserable truth which I am convinced
underlies her whole existence. She is a creature
born into a life which does not and never
will afford her the proper food for her physical
and spiritual needs. Oh, the horror in
this world, and what am I to set myself to
right it? Shut the door."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The horses are uneasy," James said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Never mind, shut the door. Clemency is
away, and Emma out in the kitchen. I must
speak to somebody, or I shall go mad."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James shut the door and turned to Gordon,
who sat rigid in his chair, his hands clutching
the arms. "Do you think I did right?" he
groaned. "You know what I did. Was it
right?"</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span>
<a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If you mean about your wife," James
said, "I think you did entirely right."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But you could not," Gordon returned
bitterly. "It was too much for you to attempt,
and yet she was nothing to you as she
was to me, and the sin would not have been
so terrible."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I had not the courage," James replied
simply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You did not think it right. You did not
wish to burden your soul with such a responsibility.
I was wrong to try to shift it upon
you, wrong and cowardly, but she was bone
of my bone and flesh of my flesh; it was a
double crime for me, murder and suicide. It
was not because you had not the courage:
you have faced surgical operations and dissecting.
You dared not commit what you
were not sure was not a crime. There is no
use in your hedging, Elliot. I know the
truth."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Still I think you did right," James said
stubbornly. "She had to die anyway. Death
was upon her. You simply hastened it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon looked at James, and his eyes
seemed to fairly blaze with somber fire; for
a moment the young man thought his reason
was unhinged. "But what am I? Who is
<span class="tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span>
<a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>any man to take whip or spur to the decrees
of the Almighty, to hasten them?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She was suffering—" James began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What of that? Who can say, though she
had led the life of a saint on earth, so far as
any one could see, what subtle sins of life itself
her pains were counteracting? Who can
tell but I have deprived her of untold joys
which would have compensated a thousand
times for those pains by shortening them?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doctor Gordon, you are morbid," James
said, looking at him uneasily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How do you know I am morbid? Then
that other—Mendon. Who is to say that I
was right even about that? It is probable I
saved your life, and possibly my own, as well
as Clemency from misery. But who can say
that death would not have been better for
both you and me than life, and even misery
for Clemency had that man lived? God had
allowed him life upon the earth. I may have
shortened that life. He was a monster of
wickedness, but who can say that he was not
a weapon of God, and that I have not done
incalculable mischief by depriving him of
that weapon? There is only one consolation
which I have with regard to him; unless my
diagnosis was entirely at fault, he would
<span class="tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span>
<a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have had that attack of erysipelas anyway.
I hardly think I deceive myself with regard
to that, and there is a very probable chance
that the attack would have been fatal. He
had nearly lost his life twice before with
the same disease. That I know, and I do not
think that unless the poison was already in
his blood, it would have developed so rapidly
from that slight bruise. So far as the simple
wound from the dog went, he was in no danger
whatever. I have that consolation in his
case, in not being absolutely certain that I
caused his death; I am not even absolutely
sure that I hastened it by any appreciable
time. He might have been attacked that
very night with the disease. Still there is,
and always will be, the slight doubt."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t think you ought to brood over
that, Doctor Gordon," James said soothingly.
He went close to the older man and laid a hand
upon his shoulder. Gordon looked up at him,
and his face was convulsed. He spoke with
solemn and tragic emphasis. "It is not for
mortal man to interfere with the ways of
God, and he does so at his own peril," he said.</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER XIV</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The confidence which Gordon had reposed
in James seemed for a time to have given him
a measure of relief. While he never for an
instant appeared like his old self, while the
games of euchre at Georgie K.&#39;s were not resumed,
nor the boyish enjoyment of things,
which James now recognized to have been
simply feverish attempts to live through the
horrible ordeal of his life and keep his sanity,
while he had now settled down into a state of
austere gloom, yet he begun again to attend to
his practice and to take interest in it. Clemency
remained away for a week. Then Gordon
brought her home. She was at the dinner-table
that night when James returned
rather late from a call on a far-off patient.
She simply said, "Good evening! Doctor Elliot,"
as if he had been the merest acquaintance,
and went on to serve his soup. James
gave her a bewildered, half-grieved, half-angered
look, which she seemed not to notice.
Immediately after dinner she went to
her own room. James, smoking with Gordon
<span class="tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span>
<a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the office, heard her go upstairs. Gordon
nodded at James through the cloud of smoke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She has taken a notion, my son," he said.
"She told me on the way home that she
wished to break the engagement with you.
She would give no reason. She wished me to
tell you. I don&#39;t take her seriously. She
cares as much for you as ever. Girls are
queer cattle. She has some utterly unimaginable
idea in her head, which will run itself
out. If I were you I would pay no attention
to it. Simply take her at her word, and let
her alone for a little while, and she herself
will urge you for a reconciliation. I know
the child. She simply cannot remain at odds
for any length of time with any one whom
she loves, and she does love you; but she is
freakish, and at times inclined to strain at
her bit. Perhaps Annie Lipton has been putting
ideas into her head against marriage in
general. She may have frightened her, and
they may have sworn celibacy together in the
watches of the night. Girls hatch more mischief
when they ought to be asleep. They are
queer cattle."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The trouble began before Clemency went
away," James said soberly. He was quite
pale.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span>
<a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Trouble? What trouble?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t know. All I know is, that the very
day when Clemency went away she seemed
changed to me. You remember how she called
out good-by, and I did not go out to help her
off as I should naturally have done."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I do remember that, and I did wonder
at your not going."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I did not go because I was quite sure that
she did not wish it. She had been very curt
with me, and had shown me unmistakably that
my attentions were not welcome."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And you don&#39;t know why? There had
been no quarrel?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not the slightest. I have not the faintest
idea what the trouble is or was, and why she
wishes to break the engagement. All I know
is that as suddenly as a weather vane turns
from west to north, she turned, and seemed
to have no more use for me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Queer," Gordon said reflectively. He
eyed James keenly. "You absolutely know
of no reason?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I absolutely know of none. Clemency is
the very first girl about whom I have ever
thought in this way. There is nothing in my
whole life, past or present, which I could not
spread before her like an open book, so far
<span class="tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span>
<a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as any fear lest it should turn her against
me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I questioned her," Gordon said, "and
she absolutely refused to give me any reason
for breaking her engagement. She simply
repeated over and over, &#39;I have changed my
mind, Uncle Tom.&#39; I asked her if she had
seen anybody else."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James flushed hotly. "What did she say
to that?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She said, &#39;Whom could I have seen,
Uncle Tom? You yourself know how many
men I have seen here, and you know I never
see men at Annie&#39;s.&#39; There is no one else.
You may be sure of that, and also sure that
she still cares for you. I know that from her
whole manner. She has simply taken one of
those unaccountable freaks which the best of
girls will take. Just let her alone, and the
whole will right itself. She may have got a
sudden scare at the idea of marriage itself,
for all I know. I still cling to the idea that
Annie Lipton has been putting ideas into her
head, in spite of what you say of her coldness
before she went there. She may have started
herself in the path, but Annie helped her further
on."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course I must leave here," James
said gloomily.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span>
<a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon started. "Leave here?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, of course. Clemency will naturally
not wish to have me a member of the household
in the existing state of things."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency will wish it. Of course you
are going to stay, Elliot."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t feel as if I could, Doctor Gordon."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nonsense!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It will naturally not be very pleasant for
me," James said, coloring.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why not?" asked Gordon irritably.
"You are not a love-sick girl."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I am not," James returned with
spirit. "I know I am jilted, but I mean to
take, and I think I am taking it, like a man.
If Clemency does not want me, I am sure I
do not want her to have me. And I can stand
seeing her daily under the altered condition
of things. I am no milk-sop. Generally
speaking, living under a roof when you are
an object of aversion to a member of the
household, is not exactly pleasant."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are not an object of aversion."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I might as well be."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon looked at the young man pitifully.
"For God&#39;s sake, then don&#39;t leave <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">me</span>, Elliot,"
he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James stared at him. There was so much
emotion in his face.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span>
<a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you think my life would be
without you?" said Gordon. "Aside from
your assistance, which I cannot do without,
you are my only solace, especially since Clemency
is in this mood. Stay for my sake, if it is
unpleasant, Elliot."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I will stay, if you feel so about it,
doctor," James replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clemency is treating you shamefully,"
Gordon said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A girl has a right to her own mind in such
a matter, if she has in anything."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The worst of it is, it is not her mind. I
tell you I know that."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not so sure."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Wait and see! You underestimate yourself,
boy."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James laughed sadly. Then there was a
knock on the office door and Georgie K. appeared.
He looked shyly at Gordon. He
had a bottle under his arm. "I have brought
over a little apple-jack; thought it might do
you good," he stammered, his great face suffused
like a girl&#39;s.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon looked affectionately at him.
"Thank you, Georgie K.," he said. "Sit
down and we will have a game. I&#39;ll get the
hot water and glasses. Emma is out."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span>
<a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ll get them," James said eagerly. He
went out to the kitchen, but Emma was not
out. She was sitting sewing in a gingham
apron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you want?" she demanded severely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James explained meekly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, go back to the office, and I&#39;ll fetch
the things," Emma said in a hostile tone.
James obeyed. Presently Emma appeared
bearing a tray with the hot water and two
glasses, Gordon did not notice the omission
of a third glass, until she had gone out.
"Why, she only brought two glasses," he
said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James felt absurdly unequal to facing
Emma again. "I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll take anything
to-night," he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nonsense!" returned Gordon. He went
to the door and shouted for Emma with no
response. "She can&#39;t have gone upstairs so
quickly," he said. But when after another
shout he got no response, he went himself
into the dining-room, and got a tumbler from
the sideboard. "She must have gone upstairs
at once," he remarked when he returned.
"The kitchen is dark."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Georgie K. did not remain very late. He
<span class="tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span>
<a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seemed nervously solicitous with regard to
Doctor Gordon. When he left he shook hands
with him, and bade him take good care of himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I love that man," Gordon said, when the
door had closed behind him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When James entered his room that night
he found fresh proof of Emma&#39;s inexplicable
hostility. The room was in total darkness.
He lit matches and searched for lamp or
candles, to find none. He fumbled his way
out into the kitchen, and got a little lamp,
which gave but a dim light, and read, as was
his habit, after he had gone to bed, with exceeding
difficulty. He also was subjected to
a most absurd annoyance from the presence
of some gritty particles in the bed. After
he extinguished his lamp he could not go to
sleep because of them, and lit his lamp again,
and tore the sheet off and shook it. The gritty
particles seemed to him to be crumbs of very
hard and dry bread. He made the bed up
again after his clumsy masculine fashion.
James had not much manual dexterity, and
rested very uncomfortably, from a pronounced
inclination of the coverings to slide
off his feet, and over one side of the bed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next morning Emma did not bring hot
<span class="tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span>
<a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>water for his shaving. She usually set a
pitcher outside his door, but this morning
there was none. He was obliged to go out to
the kitchen and prefer a request for some.
"I have jest filled up the coffee-pot and the
tea-kettle, and I guess the water ain&#39;t very
hot," Emma said in a malicious tone, as she
filled a pitcher for him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The water was not very hot. James had a
severe experience shaving, and his annoyances
were not over then. There was no napkin
beside his plate at breakfast. He did not
like to apply to Clemency, whose cold good
morning had served to establish a higher barrier
between them, and who sat behind the
coffee urn with a forlorn but none the less
severe look. He also did not like to apply
to Gordon for fear of offending her. It was
about as bad to ask Emma, but he finally did,
in a low tone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Emma apparently did not hear. He was
forced to repeat his request for a napkin
loudly. Gordon looked up. "Emma, why do
you not set the table properly?" he asked,
in a severe tone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Emma tossed her head and muttered. She
brought a napkin, and laid it beside James&#39;s
plate with an impetus as if it had been a lump
<span class="tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span>
<a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of lead. Presently James discovered that he
had only one spoon, but he made that do duty
for his cereal and coffee, and said nothing.
He was aware of Emma&#39;s eyes of covert, malicious
enjoyment upon him, as he surreptitiously
licked off the oatmeal, and put the
spoon in his coffee. He began to wonder what
he could do, if this state of things was to continue.
It all seemed so absurd, the grievances
were so exceedingly petty. He could not imagine
what had so turned Emma against him.
He was even more at a loss where she was concerned
than in Clemency&#39;s case. A girl engaged
might find some foolish reason, which
seemed enormous to her, to turn the cold
shoulder to him, but it was inconceivable that
Emma should. He had always treated her
politely, even with a certain deference, knowing,
as he did, that she was an old and faithful
servant, and as the daughter of a farmer
being, in her own estimation at least, of a
highly superior station to that of servants in
general. He could not imagine why Emma
was subjecting him to these ridiculous persecutions,
before which he was almost helpless.
She had heretofore treated him loftily, as was
her wont with everybody, except Gordon and
Clemency, but certainly she had neglected none
<span class="tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span>
<a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of her duties with regard to him. Miserable
as James was concerning Clemency, he could
not but feel that if he were to be subjected
to these incomprehensible annoyances from
Emma, life in the house would be almost impossible.
He could bear sorrow like a man,
but to bear pinpricks beside was almost too
much to ask. That noon, when he returned
from his rounds, he realized that there was
to be no cessation. Clemency was not at the
lunch-table. Gordon said she had a headache
and was lying down. Emma in passing James
his cup of tea, contrived to spill it over him.
He was not scalded, but his shirt-front and
collar were stained, thereby necessitating a
change, and he was in a hurry to be gone directly
after lunch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon roused himself, however. "Be
more careful another time, Emma," he said
sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Emma tossed her head. "Doctor Elliot
moved jest as I was coming with the cup,"
she said in a thin, waspish voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He did no such thing," Gordon said
harshly, "and if he had, it was your business
to be careful. Get Doctor Elliot another
cup of tea."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Emma obeyed with a jerk. She set the cup
<span class="tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span>
<a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and saucer down beside James&#39;s plate as hard
as she dared, and James at the first sip found
that the tea was salted. However, he said
nothing. Gordon after his outburst had resumed
his former state of apathy, and was
eating and drinking like a machine, whose
works were rusty and almost run down. He
could not trouble him with such an absurdity.
Then, too, he was too vexed to please the girl
so much. He forced himself to drink the tea
without a grimace, knowing that Emma&#39;s eyes
were upon him. But the climax was almost
reached. That night when on his return he
wished to change his collar before dinner, he
found every one with the buttonholes torn.
It was skilfully done, so skilfully that no
one could have declared positively that it had
not been done accidentally in the laundry.
James would not appear at the dinner-table
in a soiled collar, and was forced to hurry out
to the village store and purchase new ones.
These, with the exception of the one he put on,
he locked in his trunk. He was late for dinner,
and the soup was quite cold. When Doctor
Gordon complained irritably, Emma replied
with one of her characteristic tosses of
the head that she couldn&#39;t help it, Doctor
Elliot was late. James said nothing. He
<span class="tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span>
<a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>swallowed his luke-warm soup in silence. He
began to wonder what he could do. He did
not wish to complain to Doctor Gordon, especially
as the result might be the dismissal of
Emma, and he felt that he could say nothing
to Clemency about it. Clemency appeared at
the dinner-table, but she looked pale and forlorn,
and said good evening to James without
lifting her eyes. When her uncle asked
if her head was better, she said, "Yes, thank
you," in a spiritless tone. She ate almost
nothing. After dinner, James had a call to
make, and, on his return, entered by the office
door. He found Gordon fast asleep in
his chair, with the dog at his feet. The dog
started up at sight of James, but he motioned
him down, and went softly out into the hall.
There was a light there, but none in the parlor.
James heard distinctly a little sob from
the parlor. He hesitated a moment, then he
entered the room. It was suffused with moonlight.
All the pale objects stood out like
ghosts. Clemency by the window, in a little
white wool house-gown, looked, ghostly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James went straight across to her, pulled
up a chair beside her, seated himself, and
pulled one of her little hands away from her
face almost roughly, and held it firmly in spite
<span class="tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span>
<a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of her weak attempt to remove it. "Now,
Clemency," he said in a determined voice,
"this has gone quite far enough. You told
your uncle that you wished to break your engagement
to me. I have no wish to coerce
you. If you really do not want to marry me,
why, I must make the best of it, but I have a
right to know the reason why, and I will know
it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency was silent, except for her sobs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell me," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t," whispered Clemency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then Clemency let her other hand, which
contained a moist little ball of handkerchief,
fall. She turned full upon him her tearful,
swollen face. "If you want to know what
you know already," said she, in a hard voice,
"here it is. She wasn&#39;t my mother, but I
loved her like one, and you killed her."</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER XV</h1>


<p class="tei tei-p">James sat as if turned to stone. All in a
second he realized what it must be. He let
Clemency&#39;s hand go, and leaned back in his
chair. "What do you mean, Clemency?" he
asked finally, but he realized how senseless the
question was. He knew perfectly well what
she meant, and he knew perfectly well that
he was utterly helpless before her accusation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You know," said Clemency, still in her
unnatural hard voice. "You killed her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You know. You gave her more morphine,
and her heart was weak. Emma overheard
Uncle Tom say so, and that more morphine
was dangerous. She might have been
alive to-day if it had not been for you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James sat staring at the girl. She went on
pitilessly. "You did not see Emma that last
time you came upstairs," she said, "but she
saw you. She was standing in the door of
her room, and she had no light. She saw you
and Mrs. Blair going away from her room,
and she heard Mrs. Blair tell you she was
<span class="tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span>
<a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dead. You killed her. I want nothing whatever
to do with a murderer."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James remembered that draught of cold air.
It must have come from the open door of
Emma&#39;s room at the end of the hall. He
understood that Emma could not have seen
him coming upstairs, but that she had seen
him with Mrs. Blair at the door of the sick-room,
and had jumped at her conclusion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Emma knew when you went upstairs
first," said Clemency. "You left her door a
little ajar. Emma saw you giving her a hypodermic.
And then when that did not kill
her you gave her another. Uncle Tom did
not know. He must never know, for it would
kill him, but you did kill her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James was silent for a moment. He
realized the impossibility of clearing himself
from the accusation unless he told the whole
truth and implicated Doctor Gordon. Finally
he said, miserably enough, "You don&#39;t know
how horribly she was suffering, dear. You
don&#39;t know what torments she would have had
to suffer."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He knew when he said that that he incriminated
himself. Clemency retorted immediately,
"You don&#39;t know. I have heard Uncle
Tom say that nobody can ever know. She
<span class="tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span>
<a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>might have gotten well. Anyway, you killed
her." With that Clemency sprang up and
ran out of the room, and James heard her sob.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As for himself, he remained where he was
for a long time. He never knew how long.
He felt numb. He realized himself to be in
a gulf of misunderstanding, from which he
could not be extricated, even for the sake of
Clemency. It seemed to him again that he
must go away, but he remembered Gordon&#39;s
pitiful plea to him to remain. Finally he
went into his room, to find that Emma, in her
absurd malice, had left only the coverlid on
the bed. She had stripped it of the sheets
and blankets. He lay down with his clothes
on and passed a sleepless night.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next morning at the breakfast-table
he looked haggard and pale. He could eat
nothing. Doctor Gordon looked at him keenly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What is the matter, Elliot?" he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency gave a quick glance at him, and
her face worked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing," replied James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You look downright ill."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I am not ill."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency rose abruptly and left the table.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What is the matter, Clemency? Where
are you going?" Gordon called out.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span>
<a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have finished my breakfast," the girl
replied in a stifled voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon insisted on making some calls that
morning, and relieving James. "You are
worn out, my son," he said in a voice of real
affection, and clapped him on the shoulder.
He sent James on a short round in spite of
his objections, and the consequence was that
James reached home half an hour before
luncheon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was a beautiful morning. Spring seemed
to have come with a winged leap. A faint
down of green shaded the elms, and there was
a pink cloud of peach bloom in the distance.
The cherry trees were swollen almost to blossom,
and the apple trees had pale radiances
in the glance of the sun. The grass was quite
green, and here and there were dandelions.
Clemency was out in the yard, working in a
little flower-garden, as James drove in. She
had on a black dress, and her fair head was
uncovered. She pretended not to see James,
but he had hardly entered the office before she
came in. Her face was all suffused with pink.
She looked at him tenderly and angrily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Are you ill?" she said, in an indignant
voice which had, in spite of herself, soft cadences.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span>
<a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, Clemency."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then why do you look so?" she demanded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James turned at that. "Clemency, you accuse
me of cruelty," he said, "but you yourself
are cruel. You do not realize that you
cannot tell a man he is a murderer, and throw
him over when he loves you, and yet have him
utterly unmoved by it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly Clemency was in his arms. "I
love you, I love you," she sobbed. "Don&#39;t
be unhappy, don&#39;t look so. It breaks my
heart. I love you, I do love you, dear. I
can&#39;t marry you, but I love you!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If you love me, you can marry me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency shrank away, then she clung to
him again. "No," she said, "I can&#39;t get
over the thought of it. I can&#39;t help it, but I
do love you. We will go on just the same as
ever, only we will not get married. You
know we were not going to get married just
yet anyway. I love you. We will go on just
the same. Only don&#39;t look the way you did
this morning at breakfast."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How did I look?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"As if your heart were broken."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So it is, dear."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, it is not. I love you, I tell you.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span>
<a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>What is the need of bothering about marriage
anyway? I am perfectly happy being
engaged. Annie says she is never going to
get married. Let the marriage alone. Only
you won&#39;t look so any more, will you, dear?"</p>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">CHAPTER XVI</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">After this James encountered a strange
state of things: the semblance of happiness,
which almost deceived him as to its reality.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Clemency was as loving as she had ever
been. Gordon congratulated James upon the
reconciliation. "I knew the child could
never hold out, and it was Annie Lipton," he
said. James admitted that Annie Lipton
might have been the straw which turned the
balance. He knew that Clemency had not
told Gordon of her conviction that he had
given the final dose of morphine to her aunt.
Everything now went on as before. Clemency
suddenly became awake to Emma&#39;s petty
persecutions of James, and they ceased.
James one day could not help overhearing
a conversation between the two. He was in
the stable, and the kitchen windows were
open. He heard only a few words. "You
don&#39;t mean to say you are goin&#39; to hev him?"
said Emma in her strident voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I am not," returned Clemency&#39;s sweet,
decided one.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span>
<a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What be you goin&#39; with him again for
then?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James knew how the girl blushed at that,
but she answered with spirit. "That is entirely
my own affair, Emma," she said, "and
as long as Doctor Elliot remains under this
roof, and pays for it, too, he must be treated
decently. You don&#39;t pass him things, you
don&#39;t fill his lamp. Now you must treat him
exactly as you did before, or I shall tell Uncle
Tom."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You won&#39;t tell him why?" said Emma,
and there was alarm in her voice, for she
adored Gordon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did you ever know me to go from one
to another in such a way?" asked Clemency.
"You know if I told Uncle Tom, he would
not put up with it a minute. He thinks the
world of Doctor Elliot."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s awful queer how men folks can be
imposed on," said Emma.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That has nothing to do with it," Clemency
said. "You must treat Doctor Elliot respectfully,
Emma."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m jest as good as he be," said Emma
resentfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, what if you are? He&#39;s as good as
you, isn&#39;t he? And he treats you civilly. He
always has."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span>
<a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m a good deal better than he be,"
Emma went on irascibly. "I wouldn&#39;t have
gone and went, and—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hush!" ordered Clemency in a frightened
voice. "Emma, you must do as I say."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James drove out of the yard and heard no
more, but after that he had no fault to find
with Emma, so far as her service was concerned.
It is true that she gave him malignant
glances, but she made him comfortable,
albeit unwillingly. It was fortunate for him
that she did so, or he would have found his
position almost unbearable. Doctor Gordon
relaxed again into his state of apathetic
gloom. His strength also seemed to wane.
Almost the whole practice devolved upon
James. Gordon seemed less and less interested
even in extreme cases. Georgie K.
also lost his power over him. Now and then
of an evening he came, but Gordon, save to
offer him a cigar, took scarcely any notice
of him. One evening Georgie K. made a
motion to James behind Gordon&#39;s back when
he took leave, and James made an excuse to
follow him out. In the drive Georgie K.
took James by the arm, and the young man
felt him tremble. "What ails him?" asked
Georgie K.</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span>
<a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I hardly know," James replied in a
whisper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I know," said Georgie K. By the light
from the office window James could see that
the man was actually weeping. His great
ruddy face was streaming with tears. "Don&#39;t
I know?" he sobbed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James remembered the stuffed canary and
the wax flowers, and the story Gordon had
told him of Georgie K.&#39;s grief over his wife&#39;s
death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I dare say you are right," he returned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He&#39;s breakin&#39; his heart, that&#39;s what he&#39;s
doin&#39;," said Georgie K. "Can&#39;t you get him
to go away for a change or somethin&#39;?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I have tried."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He&#39;ll die of it," Georgie K. said with a
great gulp as he went out of the yard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When James reÃ«ntered the office Gordon
looked up at him. "That poor old fellow
called you out to talk about me," he said
quietly. "I know I&#39;m going downhill."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"For heaven&#39;s sake, can&#39;t you go up, doctor?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, I am done for. I could get over
losing her, but I can&#39;t get over what—you
know what."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But her death was inevitable, and greater
agony was inevitable."</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span>
<a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon turned upon him fiercely. "When
you have been as long in this cursed profession
as I have," he said, "you will realize
that nothing is inevitable. She might have
recovered for all I know. That woman, at
Turner Hill, who I thought was dying six
months ago, being up and around again, is an
instance. I tell you mortal man has no right
to thrust his hand between the Almighty and
fate. You know nothing, and I know nothing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I do know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You don&#39;t know, and you don&#39;t even know
that you don&#39;t know. There is no use talking
about this any longer. When I am gone you
must marry Clemency, and keep on with my
practice."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James considered when he was in his own
room that the event of his succeeding to the
practice might not be so very remote, but as
to his marrying Clemency he doubted. He
dared not hint of the matter to Gordon, for
he knew it would disturb him, but Clemency,
as the days went on, became more and more
variable. At times she was loving, at times it
was quite evident that she shrank from him
with a sort of involuntary horror. James began
to wonder if they ever could marry. He
<span class="tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span>
<a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was fully resolved not to clear himself at the
expense of Doctor Gordon; in fact, such a
course never occurred to him. He had a very
simple straightforwardness in matters of
honor, and this seemed to him a matter of
honor. No question with regard to it arose in
his mind. Obviously it was better that he
should bear the brunt than Gordon, but he did
ask himself if it would ever be possible for
Clemency to dissociate him from the thought
of the tragedy entirely, and if she could not,
would it be possible for her to be happy
as his wife? That very day Clemency had
avoided him, and once when he had approached
she had visibly shrunk and paled.
Evidently the child could not help it. She
looked miserably unhappy. She had grown
thin lately, and had lost almost entirely her
sense of fun, which had always been so ready.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James went to sleep, wondering how she
would treat him the next day. He never
knew, for the girl shifted like a weather-cock,
driven hither and yon by her love and terror
like two winds. The next day, however,
solved the problem in an entirely unexpected
fashion. James, that morning after breakfast,
during which Clemency had sat pale
and stern behind the coffee-urn, and scarcely
had noticed him, set off on a round of calls.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span>
<a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Doctor Gordon, to his surprise, announced
his intention of making some calls himself;
he said that he would take the team, and
James must drive the balky mare, as the bay
was to be taken to the blacksmith&#39;s. Gordon
that morning looked worse than usual, although
he evinced such unwonted energy.
He trembled like a very old man. He ate
scarcely anything, and his mouth was set
hard with a desperate expression. James
wished to urge him to remain at home, but
he did not dare. Gordon, when he left the
breakfast-table, proposed that James should
take Clemency with him, but the girl replied
curtly that she was too busy. Gordon started
on his long circuit, and James set off to make
the rounds of Alton and Westover. The
mare seemed in a very favorable mood that
morning. She did not balk, and went at a
good pace. It was not until James was on
his homeward road that the trouble began.
Then the mare planted her four feet at
angles, in her favorite fashion, and became
as immovable as a horse of bronze. James
touched her with the whip. He was in no
patient mood that morning. Finally he lashed
her. He might as well have lashed a stone,
for all the effect his blows had. Then he got
out and tried coaxing. She did not seem to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span>
<a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even see him. Her great eyes had a curious
introspective expression. Then he got again
into the buggy and sat still. A sense of obstinacy
as great as the animal&#39;s came over
him. "Stand there and be d——d!" he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Go without your dinner if you want to."
He leaned back in a corner of the buggy,
and began reflecting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His reflections were at once angry and
gloomy. He was, he told himself, tired of
the situation. He began to wonder if he
ought not, for the sake of self-respect, to
leave Alton and Clemency. He wondered if
a man ought to submit to be so treated, and
yet he recognized Clemency&#39;s own view of
the situation, and a great wave of love and
pity for the poor child swept over him. The
mare had halted in a part of the road where
there were no houses, and flowering alders
filled the air with their faint sweetness.
Under that sweetness, like the bass in a harmony,
he could smell the pines in the woods
on either hand. He also heard their voices,
like the waves of the sea. It was a very
warm day, one of those days in which Spring
makes leaps toward Summer. James felt uncomfortably
heated, for the buggy was in the
full glare of sunlight. All his solace came
from the fact that he himself, sitting there
<span class="tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span>
<a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so quietly, was outwitting the mare by showing
as great obstinacy as her own. He knew
that she inwardly fretted at not arousing irritation.
That a tickle, even a lash of the whip,
would delight her. He sat still, leaning his
head back. He was almost asleep when he
heard a rumble of heavy wheels, and looking
ahead languidly perceived a wagon laden with
household goods of some spring-flitters approaching.
He sat still and watched the great
wagon drawn by two lean, white horses, and
piled high with the poor household belongings—miserable
wooden chairs and feather beds,
and a child&#39;s cradle rocking imminently on
the top. A lank Jerseyman was driving. By
his side on the high seat was his stout wife
holding a baby. The weak wail of the child
filled the air. James looked to make sure
that there was room for the team to pass.
He thought there was, and sat idly watching
them. The woman looked at him, made some
remark to the man, and then both grinned
weakly, recognizing the situation. The man
on the team drove carefully, but a stone on
the outer side caused his team to swerve a
trifle. The wheels hit the wheels of the buggy,
and the cradle tilted swiftly on to the back
of the balky mare, and she bolted. In all her
experience of a long, balky life, a cradle as
<span class="tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span>
<a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a means of breaking her spirit had not been
encountered. James had not time to clutch
the lines which had fallen to the floor of the
buggy before he was thrown out. He felt the
buggy tilting to its fall, he heard a crashing
sound and a fierce kicking, and then he knew
no more.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When he came to himself he was on the
lounge in Doctor Gordon&#39;s office. Emma was
just disappearing with a pitcher in the direction
of the kitchen, and he felt something cool
on his forehead. He smelled aromatic salts,
and heard a piteous little voice, like the bleat
of a wounded lamb, in his ears, and kisses on
his cheeks, and a soft hand rubbing his own.
"Oh, darling," the little voice was saying,
"oh, darling, are you much hurt? Are you?
Please speak to me. It is Clemency. Oh,
he is dead! He is dead!" Then came wild
sobs, and Emma rushed into the room, and
he heard her say, "Here, put this ice on his
head, quick!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James was still so faint that he could only
gasp weakly. And he could open his eyes to
nothing but darkness and a marvellous spinning
and whir as of shadows in a wind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He&#39;s comin&#39; to," said Emma. Her voice
sounded as if she felt moved. "Don&#39;t take
<span class="tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span>
<a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on so, Miss Clemency," she said; "he ain&#39;t
dead."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again James felt the soft kisses and tears
on his face, and again came the poor little
voice, "Oh, darling, please listen, please
don&#39;t do so. I will marry you. I will. I
know you did just right. I read one of Uncle
Tom&#39;s books this morning, and I found out
what awful suffering she might have had
hours longer. You did right. I will marry
you. I will never think of it again. Please
don&#39;t look so. Are you dreadfully hurt?
Oh, when they came bringing you in I
thought you were killed! There is a great
bruise on your head. Does it hurt much?
You do feel better, don&#39;t you? Oh, Emma,
if Uncle Tom would only come. Can&#39;t you
hear me, dear? I will marry you. I take it
all back. I will marry you! I will marry
you whenever you wish. Oh, please look at
me! Please speak to me! Oh, Emma, there is
Uncle Tom. I am so glad."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then poor, little Clemency, all unstrung
and frightened, sank into an unconscious
little heap on the floor as Gordon
entered. "What the devil?" he cried out.
"I saw the buggy smashed on the road, and
that mare went down the Ford Hill road like
a whirlwind. What, Elliot, are you hurt,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span>
<a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>boy? Clemency, Emma, what has happened?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">All the time Gordon was talking he was
examining James, who was now able to speak
feebly. "The mare was frightened and threw
me," he gasped. "I was stunned. I am all
right now. See to Clemency!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Clemency was already staggering
weakly to her feet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Uncle Tom, he isn&#39;t killed, is he?"
she sobbed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Killed, no," said Gordon, "but he will be
if you don&#39;t stop crying and making a goose
of yourself, Clemency."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We put ice on his head," sobbed Clemency.
"He isn&#39;t—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Of course he isn&#39;t. He was only stunned.
That is only a flesh wound."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I tried to git some brandy down him, but
I couldn&#39;t," said Emma.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Give it to me," said Gordon. He poured
out some brandy in a spoon, and James swallowed
it. "He will be all right now," Gordon
said. "You won&#39;t be such a beauty that
the women will run after you for a few days,
Elliot, but you&#39;re all right."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I feel all right," James said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It is nothing more than a little boy with
a bump on his forehead," said Gordon to
Clemency. "Now, child, stop crying, and go
<span class="tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span>
<a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and bathe your eyes. Emma, is luncheon
ready?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When both women had gone Gordon, who
had been applying some ointment to James&#39;s
forehead, said in a low voice, broken by emotion,
"You are all right, Elliot, but—you did
have a close call."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose I did," James said, laughing
feebly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He essayed to rise, but Gordon held him
down. "No, keep still," he said. "You must
not stir to-day. I will have your luncheon
brought in. Clemency will be only too happy
to wait on you, hand and foot."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Poor little girl, I must have given her an
awful fright," said James.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, you are not exactly the looking object
to do anything else," said Gordon laughing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where is there a glass?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where you won&#39;t have it. You won&#39;t be
scarred. It is simply a temporary eclipse of
your beauty, and Clemency will love you all
the more for it. You need not worry. Talk
about the vanity of women. I thought you
were above it, Elliot. Now lie still. If you
get up you will be giddy."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">James lay still, smiling. He felt very
happy, and his love for Clemency seemed
<span class="tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span>
<a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>like a glow of pure radiance in his heart. He
lay on the office lounge all the afternoon. He
fell asleep with Clemency sitting beside holding
his hand. Gordon had gone out to finish
the calls. It was six o&#39;clock before he drove
into the yard. James had just awakened
and lay feeling a great peace and content.
Clemency was smiling down at his discolored
face, as if it were the face of an angel.
The windows were open, and the distant lowing
of cattle, waiting at homeward bars, the
monotone of frogs, and the songs of circling
swallows came in. James felt as if he saw in
a celestial vision the whole world and life,
and that it was all blessed and good, that
even the pain and sorrow blossomed in the
end into ineffable flowers of pure delight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But when Doctor Gordon entered this
vision was clouded, for Gordon&#39;s face had
reassumed its old expression of settled melancholy
and despair. He inquired how James
found himself with an apathetic air, and then
sat down and mechanically filled his pipe.
After it was filled he seemed to forget to light
it, so deep was his painful reverie. He sat
with it in hand, staring straight ahead. Then
a strange thing happened. The office door
opened and Mrs. Blair, the nurse, entered.
She was dressed in black, she carried a black
<span class="tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span>
<a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>travelling bag, and she wore a black bonnet,
with a high black tuft on the top by way of
trimming. Mrs. Blair was very tall, and this
black tuft, when she entered the door, barely
grazed the lintel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon rose and said good evening, and
regarded her in a bewildered fashion, as did
James and Clemency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Blair spoke with no preface. "I am
going to leave Alton," she said in her severe
voice, "and I want to tell you something
first, and to say good-by." She looked at
Gordon, then at the others, one after another,
then at Gordon again. "I did not
think at first that it would be necessary for
me to say what I am going to," she continued,
"but I overheard some things that
were said that night, and I have been thinking—and
then I heard the other day (I don&#39;t
know how true it is) that Clemency and Doctor
Elliot had had a falling out, and I didn&#39;t
know but—I didn&#39;t quite know what anybody
thought, and I wanted you all to know
the truth. I didn&#39;t want any mistakes made
to cause unhappiness." She hesitated, her
eyes upon Doctor Gordon grew more intense.
"Maybe <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">you</span> think you gave her that dose
of morphine that killed her," she said
steadily, "but you didn&#39;t. Doctor Elliot
<span class="tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span>
<a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gave her water, and you gave her mostly
water. I had diluted the morphine, and you
didn&#39;t know it. I had made up my mind that
she was going to have the morphine, but I
had made up my mind that nobody but me
should have the responsibility of it. I&#39;m all
alone in the world, and my conscience upheld
me, and I felt I&#39;d rather take the blame,
if there was to be any. I made up my mind
to wait till a certain time and then give it to
her, and I did. I am the one who gave her
the morphine that killed her. I am going to
leave Alton for good. My trunk is down at
the station. I came to tell you that I gave
her the morphine, and if I did wrong in helping
God to shorten her sufferings, I am the
one to be punished, and I stand ready to bear
the punishment."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gordon looked at her. He did not speak,
but it was with his face as if a mask of dreadful
misery had dropped from it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Good-by!" said Mrs. Blair. She went
out of the door, and the black tuft on her
bonnet barely grazed the lintel.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
